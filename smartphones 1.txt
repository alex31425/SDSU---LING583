66480762	I got this phone a long time ago as a phone for texting and calling only. It was ok, but since I have an iPhone now, it's good for beginners. The phone back breaks easily, and the camera is good for this phone.Hope this review helps! 	sanarauf	10-18-2015 11:27:54	Comparison	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Enclosure		true
66970010	I love my Lumia 1020, and while app and feature availability is lacking on Windows Phone 8, that's not Nokia's fault. Once again, they've produced a product with incredible build quality. The camera very much lives up to the hype, and this was primary reason I chose this over another iPhone. Still, overall I do like Windows Phone, particularly the live times, which appeal to my A.D.D. - get bored with my screen, wait five seconds and it completely changes. 	sanarauf	10-18-2015 11:27:54	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

64660601	This phone is great but I am pretty upset ... Why? Because I will never be able to use a smaller screen again. Just kidding but I bought this from Amazon because I got bored with my iPhone 4s. I've been with iPhone since 2007 and me leaving for Android was something I was real hesitant to do, but that big screen was tempting, I decided to do it and don't regret it one bit. Even though the unlocked Note has a faster processor, this phone is still super fast and has blazing fast LTE. My only concern was the battery life and I am even happy with that. I can go a full day and some on a single charge. Of course I rooted the phone and added a custom rom so I expected this (custom roms are more battery friendly then stock Android). When I was on stock I could still make it most of the day with moderate-heavy usage (By heavy I mean internet, twitter, instagram, messaging, music, it was just non stop usage). The camera is great, photos look amazing even in low lighting, and the screen is like an HD television. You can even buy a bluetooth keyboard and and hook up a mouse to use this thing like a computer! The S pen is a great feature even though I don't use it much. The only real complaint I have is how long it takes to charge which is around 3 hours, I mean you have to expect it because the battery is HUGE (2500mAh) so yeah it takes awhile to charge. After the first few battery cycles however charging time will improve. Anyway the phone itself is just a beautiful sight to look at, I get compliments everywhere I go like Whoa look at the size of that thing! no but seriously everyone is shocked at the size and then they instantly love it. In all honesty I was a bit nervous when I first received it because it really is a big phone, but after a week I viewed it as a normal size phone and everyone elses as too small (seriously I can't go any smaller now), and I would even considered going bigger. I can't wait for the Galaxy Note 2 which is rumored to arrive in December. Honestly if you don't care about 4G LTE (because that's the ATT Note's specialty) then I would get the unlocked Galaxy Note N7000 it has a faster processor and better battery life. Both are great phones however, and I wouldn't trade this thing for any other phone not even the new Samsung Galaxy S III. It's the best Android phone ever! 	sanarauf	10-18-2015 11:27:54	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

For my purposes, I would agree that this is about the best unlocked phone you can buy for the price, especially if you prefer android.

65182483	To start, I am a technology driven person that likes to have the newest and greatest tech when available, and to say that I am disappointed by this phone would be an understatement. To start this phone is RIDDLED with hardware and software problems that some days have me wanting my old iPhone back. But I digress...please read below to better understand this phone before you fall and do what I did...waste over $500 on a phone worth far less.1.) Display and Appearance (8/10)I will admit the display on this phone is amazing and it is a sexy phone. With it's 3.7 screen there is a nice amount of real estate with regards to the images and the phone. But, while it is nice to look at and spectacular for watching HD videos....the screen in the sun is not so nice. While I don't mind some glare or having to look a little harder in sunlight due to the obviousness of having the type of screen it has, it is down right impossible to see out in sunlight and as we approach summer I rarely want to pull my phone out of the pocket to use it. But I'm not going to hold that (too much)against the phone, as it is a nice and strong screen that impresses with its lush colors.Performance (3/10)This is where the phone falls right on its face. Though the android market is starting to grow at an exponential rate it can only help it so much. There are numerous issues that I have with this phone thus I will just list them:1.) Having full bars and being told that a text could not be sent2.) Constant force close by applications...INCLUDING THE ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM3.) Dropped Calls4.) Not being able to hear people or vice versa unless I take the battery out and then put it back in (with full bars as well).5.) Phone randomly deciding to reboot itself with full battery.The list truly goes on, but these problems make me not want to use the phone some days. The only reason this gets a 3 instead of a 1 is because of the multitasking capabilities, Google navigation, and its ability to sync with Google. The one thing I have a very hard time understanding is that if this phone has a 1.0 GHz Snapdragon processor, why am I looking at a frozen screen for over 5-10 seconds sometimes when I press the home button? Speaking of the buttons. The pressure sensitive buttons are very hit or miss. They sometimes work and sometimes don't, sometimes they will just go off without even touching them, which gets old...quick.Battery (4/10)While I understand that most smart phone will need to be recharged almost every day due to the amount that we use them for (internet, apps, widgets, phone, texting, etc...) I am not surprised that the battery does not last long. What I am surprised about is that I will leave my house at 10 AM to head off to meetings and need to grab my charger at 7 PM because the battery is almost dead. While I understand OMG get an app killer program to get rid of the things in the background! that only works so well. I have one installed and I clear all my apps almost every hour but the battery is still pretty terrible. I wish that the battery in here was worth it, but it is not.Sound Quality: (1/10 or 9/10)This phone is very touchy with regards to the sound quality. As I stated earlier there are numerous times when the other person can not hear me and I can not hear them. While at the same time, the dual mic system works amazingly well such that it allows for people to not hear any of my background noise and just me or not hear me at all and just the muffled background noises. It is very hard to say the sound quality on this because it is so hit or miss. And the sound quality of the speaker and audio; forget about it. It is muffled or very low and not worth it.Overall I give this phone a 5/10 but that is a 50% and makes this phone still a failing phone not worth the price of admission. Once the iPhone 4 launches I will be grabbing that as I can not stand this phone much longer. 	l3g4cy	10-19-2015 14:56:07	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	Replacement	Operating System	Enclosure		false

64700018	Overall, this phone is quite responsive and pocketable. The interface reacts quickly despite being a resistive type touch screen. Also is a great video and mp3 player. However, on the software side it falls short. The pc software does not recognize the phone when you try to back it up, and the firmware cannot be updated as well-also, when you watch a video and turn the phone to its side for landscape viewing it is okay, but when turn it to its other landscape side the video is displayed upside down. I found that the browser also has trouble rendering some popular websites correctly. Finally, the phone can only record video and voice using the amr codec which results in very disappointing low quality sound recordings. Worldwide, this phone sells for about 450-500usd as of 7/09. 	belijah3	10-19-2015 23:05:37	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Upgrade	Operating System	No Defect		false

66369080	This is hand's down the best smart phone currently released in the US, if you can handle the size. This is definitely a big phone, but for most guys, it still fits as comfortably in your hands and pockets. I say as comfortably because I already detest having the iphone in my pocket, such as when I am siting, even though it is already such a puny phone.The screen is large and full HD carrying all the awesomeness for which Samsung screens are known.I recommend the phone as I have had no regrets buying it at full price 4 months before it was ever released in the US (since all the good phones sans iphone take forever to make it pass US regulations and phone company greed). 	belijah3	10-19-2015 23:05:37	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
64845596	Wow!  This is a BEAUTIFUL phone, kicks butt of flip version of Shine from Verizon.  Slider is sweet, phone feels solid.  AND boy DOES it SHINE!!.... in virtually most lighting.  Roll bar select key is a bit tricky at first but soon becomes very natural, AND you look so cool because of it!  Has basic goodies, SIM card very accessible and compatible, battery life better than average.  Standard MP3 player.  Has microSD expansion slot for up to 2GB.  Slight problems with reception outside of major metropolitan areas and some dead spots in small cities due to tri-band but overall pretty good (I use ATT/Cingular).  Tons of cool ringtones and sound effects.  Mirrored effect slightly difficult to read in strong sunlight.  USB connection to desktop worked effortlessly like direct plug flash drive.  Camera quite decent although some delay in trigger.  Has flash but only on/off - no auto.  2 megapixel photos are better than most.  Hottest slider around, no doubt.  I use this as my cool factor phone.  Highly recommend it!  Please check out tri-band reception in your area first to avoid disappointment. 	belijah3	10-19-2015 23:05:37	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65300228	Just bought this phone yesterday and it is my first touch screen phone. Till now I've always had clam shell type flip phones but got to the point where I wanted to be able to do some stuff like check email and messenger and google maps etc. I bought this phone on a whim and now see the big geek sites don't exactly give it rave reviews. I guess they're just used to all the bells and whistles you get with the I phone and the top tier phones like Samsung galaxy etc but those cost a bundle and this phone was under $100 and if you want a great starter smart phone that won't break the bank this is it.I've had no problems, can't say it's real intuitive though partly it is but it's just very different from the type menus and things you do on a non smart phone. But it's not been too hard at all and I'm 65 so I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks. I'm not a stranger to technology and get by ok on computers but this is definitely a new experience but I'm loving it. To me the phone is quick and responsive, the graphics are excellent and the 3mp camera does a fine job and there's all kinds of editing software to do different things with your pics once you've taken them.My big concern was being able to type texts on a touch screen as I was used to using predictive text (T-9) on my flip phone. But this phone comes with Swype a software program that lets you just drag your finger from the first letter of a word to the last and it automatically puts  your word in for you and it learns your words too! What could be better?The phone takes an SD memory card up to 32 GB which is awesome and since I was already on T-Mobile I just switched my sim card from my old phone to this one and was ready to go. I like the size of the phone , didn't want one of the bigh giant ones and this 3.5 screen is just fine for me . I've had no problems seeing the details or reading, it's much bigger than any thing I ever had on a flip phone.So while this may not be the phone for you if you're used to a Galaxy 3 or Apple I-phone etc I would definitely recommend it as a first touch screen phone or to anyone who wants all the basic functions of web, text and calling but doesn't have or want to spend a bundle or finance a phone. And the calls are crystal clear and loud by the way. My callers tell me I sound much better than I did on my Sony Ericsson flip phone and I hear them better as well. 	belijah3	10-19-2015 23:10:05	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66873929	Great affordable compact phone. Dual SIM-capable, if needed. After repeated use, I may need to look for another for these reasons:1) Too small. Device is slick so it's a slippery phone. Every time I try to hit the # key the phone flies away from my hands. I suppose there is a thing as too small a phone. Easy to hold if you're talking. Not so easy to hold if you need to use the keypad.2) This phone is useless as a speakerphone in the car while while in motion. Unless you've Bluetooth'd the phone to your car you can't really hear the other party.3) No headphone jack. So if you can't use the speakerphone try the headphone jack.

66248306	After reading so many reviews both negative and positive I decided to make the move. My local Radio Shack had a limited time promotion on the HTC Evo 3D for Virgin mobile and knowing the problems I was having with my Motorola Triumph I had to make the move. Especially since I would have 30 Days to return it back to the store. Here are the facts:GPS on the evo connects in 10 seconds and that's in my house (I use waze app all the time)Triumph can't connect in my house and usually takes more than 5 minutes to connect.Audio is louder and sounds better on the HTC Evo (especially with poweramp app)Triumph has a problem when you unplug earphones and replug in the sound jumps.HTC Evo has no lag when pressing buttons or appsTriumph has lag and sometime you must press 3 timesCall quality is better on the HTC Evo and testing this in low signal areas I haven't missed any callsTriumph sounds muffledHTC Evo 3d pictures give me a headache, 2d pictures are very nice, I don't see a major difference between either phone.Battery on the HTC Evo beats the  Triumph hands down. And I like the option to add a larger battery if needed. I use 2x battery saver app.Sent a text message in a low signal area and 1 time received a radio interference message, but the text still went through.3G is noticeably faster (I used speedtest.net) with my old Motorola and the HTC next to each other. I'm sure this is because of the dual processor and improved memory in the HTC.4G is insane! 7,485 kbps download.If someone calls you and you can't take the message and they leave you a message on voicemail, you can listen to the message without dialing into voice mail and delete it after listening so no minutes are used, very cool! On the motorola triumph you had to dial into voice mail.BTW, my Motorola triumph was on the $25 dollar plan and my wife was using a Samsung intercept so I gave her my Motorola. If anyone has upgraded from the Samsung intercept to the Motorola triumph. You know its a no brainer and the Motorola wins hands over, but although the upgrade from the Motorola to the HTC Evo is not as drastic, it is an improvement over the quirky things that the Motorola does....UPDTATE1:Have had the phone for 1 month and haven't missed 1 call. There are reviews that say they have had call problems or texting problems. See update #5.UPDATE #2:Factory battery is better than the triumph, but I order the extended Laza Zcell battery and cover for the HTC Evo on Amazon. The reviews are incredible and the battery lasts for more than 2 day on normal use!UPDATE #3 Revised:Received the Laza Zcell battery and cover and it is fantastic. The cover fits perfectly, charged the battery overnight and my 2x battery saver app says I have 114hrs till the battery runs out! Mfg says you will get max battery after 5 charges. The bottom of the back case pops out about 3/16 and the rest of the case stays slim. This actually makes the phone easier to hold and with the new back cover the top power button is easier to operate. Also you will not need a battery saver app with this battery, but if you do it will extend your battery operation even longer! After 5 charges, and the phone being on for 7hours, my 2x battery saver app says I have 191hrs left! This is insane!UPDATE #4The HTC Android version is 4.06. It has some very cool settings that are not on the Motorola. For example. When the phone is ringing you can set it to lower the ring tone automatically when you pick the phone up. You can also increase the ring when it is in a bag or pouch and it will lower when the phone is pulled out of the bag. You can also set your phone to automatically go to speaker phone when you turn it upside down.UPDATE #5I received a text from my brother (I don't really text much at all) when I responded I received the weird code alert and radio freq message, I selected OK on the message and I believe it still went through. My response to my brother didn't require a response but it did remind me of all the people that are complaining about texting on this phone. Here is what I did, go to your phone keypad and type ##25327# then a screen pops up, at the top press the word menu, it will then say reset, press reset, then select yes to resetting and saving personal info....This should fix any texting issues. I did this and have not had any radio interference messages since. Keep in mind this is not the same as going to the PRL update. It is more than that and resets your phone with out loosing your personal data.UPDATE #6Still loving this phone! Did more texting this month with my family with no problems. Everything above still stands. This is without a doubt the best VM phone I have ever had. If you have a 3D tv, you can take 3D videos and set your 3D on your tv to side by side and watch your videos in 3d. Very cool, much better than watching 3D on your phone. Still experimenting. Also one thing I don't like is to answer a call you must move the green icon into a circle. So I installed an app called easy answer. Now when a call comes in I can look at the phone and just hold it to my ear and it will automatically answer. It detects that you have the phone by your ear. How cool is that? Also I installed a 16gb sd card so I could install my favorite movies. I found that the phone is so powerful (dual core CPU) that it will play HD videos that my old Motorola triumph would not play! Love this phone and I'm so surprised that there are so many negative reviews.UPDATE #7Just leased a new vehicle and needed a good HTC 3D Evo smartphone holder. Found the iOttie one touch smartphone holder. It is easily the best vehicle holder I have ever found. Amazon sells it, check it out, you won't be disappointed it attached to my dashboard that like many has a non smooth vinyl and fastened beautifully. Its 12 degrees in NJ today and its working without a problem. It will also attach to your windshield. Just sharing with all the HTC 3D evo fans. One negative is it will not work with the extended battery. So I'm back on the original factory batteryWill update as I use it more.... Very happy with this HTC Evo 3g V. 	belijah3	10-19-2015 23:20:17	Comparison	Performance Defect	Both	Upgrade	Operating System	Internal Hardware		false

67015253	The Samsung T301G is the one slider phone offered by Tracfone as I write this review. I bought it to replace Mrs. Spudman's T Mobile pay as you go phone. We have no problem with T Mobile, just that particular phone.The Samsung is a small, light, many featured phone for someone who doesn't need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive fancy phones. Mostly we just want to make and receive phone calls on the go without being burdened by a service contract with a monthly bill.Though she's a technophobe, Mrs. Spudman had little trouble setting up the phone and her voicemail account using the included instructions.  My own phone is an LG Tracfone model; I have been very happy with Tracfone and find it easy to add minutes and check my account either on the phone or on the Tracfone site.Likes:Easy set upThe display - clear, bright and easy to read. When placing or receiving a call, phone numbers appear on the screen in large digits. Love it!The ringer is loud and very audible. Choices of ring tones are limited and don't match those of the fancy phones, but they are more than adequate for our tastes. Additional ring tone choices are available on the Tracfone site for a fee. They're really nothing special though.Voice quality on this phone is excellent at both ends of the phone call. It's as good as our land line's and better than that of my LG phone.The external Caller ID. When your phone rings, the caller's number is displayed on the screen. The user can then choose to accept or not accept the call.Battery life has been more than acceptable for us. Mrs. Spudman turns off the phone's power overnight to make the charge last even longer. Charging is conveniently simple and doesn't take that long. You can charge the phone in your car or at home.I bought the phone's optional accessory package which includes a case, earphones, and two chargers and adapters. A great deal. The phone also came with some starter minutes and double minutes for life, a great, great feature.  At the time I ordered, I even got a ten dollar restaurant gift certificate.The phone was easy to hook up to our hands free Bluetooth  in our 2011Legacy.Dislikes -  NONE so far.Some of the features:Text messaging, voice mail, free caller ID, free call waitingBluetoothSlider designVGA camera with decent picturesColor screen displayMMS picture messaging - My wife and daughter exchange photos regularlyHandsfree speakerHearing Aid CompatibleDouble minutes for life - This is a deal maker.For the low price, features, and lack of any long term commitment, I don't think you can go wrong with this phone. If you want cutting edge technology, look elsewhere and be prepared to empty your wallet. 	belijah3	10-19-2015 23:32:44	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
65168281	The phone has no service at my home.  It has service in most cities but that doesn't help me.  The also needs charging almost daily.

66091700	This is the second Tracfone I've purchased for my mother, who incidentally is 82 years young. The Motorola I bought her in 2006 finally just played out. After shopping around, the LG 235C seemed to be the best choice for her. It's a very friendly phone for seniors who want an inexpensive and simple to use non-smartphone. It's easy to navigate the menus; the buttons are relatively large, and it's a lot less expensive than a Samsung Jitterbug. (GreatCall plans are more expensive, too; almost twice the basic annual cost and 25% fewer minutes.) For pay-as-you-go service, with double minutes for life, a hardware cost of $19.99, and better than average area coverage, you just can't do much better than Tracfone.One or two people wrote that Tracfone's customer service was bad. I used them a few years ago, and I don't remember it being any more difficult than Bank of America or ATT;'s customer service. All of them can be frustrating at times. However, when I activated this phone, it was a simple matter of going to Tracfone's website and following the prompts.One other thing, after you have Activated the phone, set it aside for an hour or so. It takes Tracfone's system about that long to complete the activation process. 	belijah3	10-19-2015 23:41:20	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

27204607	This is really a great phone. Elegant construction, very classy. The PureView camera is awesome, and the screen is the best I have seen. It is really easy to read in the sunlight, and the colors just pop. As a GREAT added plus, you get Nokia Drive and Maps for free, which are the best there is. Free streaming music from Nokia Music app (ad-free), is just another killer bonus. Plus, Nokia does not abandon you once you buy their phones; they are the best when it comes to pushing software updates to their customers.Finally, go look online for the drop test videos. Remarkable. This thing is solid. About as unbreakable as a phone can get. No bumper-covers needed for this baby. Overall, a great phone from a great company. 	belijah3	10-19-2015 23:41:20	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

83454710	I have had this phone for around 6-8 months and cannot wait to get a different one. It operates pretty well most of the time (mainly the times when your not in need of its features) The signal is very finicky and often will jump from 4G to analog in the same location (this leads to many voice mails that pop up without a call first not to mention the missed called that don't leave VM). When sending text messages it often takes a very long time to send out and occasionally will take hours to send a message without me realizing. The NFC feature (one of the reasons I choose the Spectrum II) is horrible and compleatly dysfunctional and continuously needs reprogrammed defeating the purpose of the feature in the first place. DON'T BUY THIS PHONE with all the options out there you can certainly find something more reliable and functional. 	belijah3	10-19-2015 23:46:43	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Other	Operating System	No Defect		false

64159440	I'm going to make this review short and sweet. First off, I simply love this phone and is the best smart phone I've ever owned. It's smokin' fast and multitasks like no ones business. The interface is very user friendly and navigating around is a cinch. The only reason I gave this four stars rather than five was for the camera.  Don't get me wrong, it takes good pictures but for a 13 megapixel camera it should take incredible pictures that blow even the Iphone cameras out of the water and that it does not. Other than the that this phone simply rocks.  Quit thinking about it and get it! 	belijah3	10-19-2015 23:46:43	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	No Defect	Camera		false
14488147	I happen to own an ATT; lumia 900 after I had the unlock code given by ATT; last October 8, 2012  but soon I realized that while the screen is crisp, a lot of the screen remained unused until the day I got the windows 7.8 last January 31, 2013. The experience dramatically changed for the better with the resizeable tiles of the windows phone 8 format. I decided against buying an ATT; locked phone because even when it has been unlocked, the hotspot function remains disabled (Disabled by ATT;) and therefore can't be shared. There is no WCDMA-only network choice hence, so much of my connection is 2G or Edge which is so disappointingly slow. This limited connectivity held me back from upgrading to the newer lumia 920 but, I soon discovered that you can actually commit network connectivity to 3g only (equivalent to WCDMA-only) by dialing ##3282#. After that discovery, it did not take me long to get the upgraded Lumia 920. So much for the introduction I found the following positives for this Nokia lumia 920 vs 900.1. Fast response and buttery smooth operation.2. Resizeable tiles and fonts are really nice.3. The camera is heaven and earth different and much much better compared to older lumia 900.4. 3G-only connectivity can be set by dialing ##3282 on windows phone 8.5. The charging port is now below rather than on top...I love it!6. Nice crisp screen.7. Built-in wallet App is really cool. By putting your card name number, security code and expiry, it  automatically identifies your billing information and address. This is now readily available to purchase Apps.8. Whilie there maybe Apps missing windows 8 makes it easy to pin sites making it handy for access from the screen.This is my fourth generation windows phone and after having used Samsung Galaxy Nexus as my second phone as I normally carry two rather than just one, I eventually gravitated back to windows phone after I discovered how to dedicate network connectivity to 3G only. If only people will give it a shot, it is a very nice and capable OS.......if microsoft will succeed in integrating the windows market place for windows phone 8 Apps  that are  compatible with windows 8 PC OS, it will really become a force to reckon with in the future!!!I believe that the future is great for windows to shine down the road!!! 	belijah3	10-19-2015 23:46:43	Comparison	Performance Defect	Software	Replacement	Operating System	No Defect		false

Sometimes, I don't get notifications when I get texts or calls and I have it to where I'd get them, but I get none at all sometimes! Also, the music. The music sometimes doesn't cooperate and won't turn on. Not only that, but the phone shuts off randomly and takes a while to come back on, sometimes I have to press the power button to get it back on, and it does it when FULLY CHARGED. Lastly, silence mode. I have it on silent when I go to school and once, it went off IN CLASS on silent mode! Luckily it didn't get me in trouble...I checked it after it rang- said it was on SILENT!

64850505	They sold me a defective product and wouldn't  give me a reasonable answer to my claims.

The battery won't get fully charged and it runs out of power pretty quick. The phone was out of warranty for more than 100 days as apple support let me know through live chat, which means I have to pay 200 bucks plus to get my phone fixed.If they list the product as brand new DO NOT believe in this! They sell used, defective items as they were brand new. If you want an unlocked Iphone get it from the apple website directly, and if out of the US, buy it from some other store. They're scammers.So if you don't want your money to be #34;decently#34; stolen or to be cheated DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM UNLOCKED FONES 	belijah3	10-20-2015 00:39:59	Complaint	Unable to Use	Both	Replacement	Operating System	Internal Hardware		false

There is not enough internal memory available to use in the phone and you are limited to what apps you can install on the sd card. 	belijah3	10-20-2015 00:56:07	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	No Defect	Internal Hardware		false

56362527	I admit I opted for simple  cheap when I purchased this phone.  It IS a good phone, don't get me wrong, but I've determined it's really not suitable for me because I live on a small ranch and am outside every day for several hours at a time.  After the initial frustration of trying to figure out how to work the phone (because the little booklet with microscopic lettering doesn't really explain the basics), I've found that  I can't put the phone in my pocket because the slightest pressure causes it to dial.  I even bought a hard leather case with a belt clip but that didn't work either!  I think I've got the phone itself pretty much figured out but using it outside is not gonna work.  I'm 65 years old but definitely not #34;elderly#34;, and I need a phone that I can carry with me outside.  I don't want a smartphone or anything with all those bells  whistles.  I just want something that's simple, easy to use, and has a good antenna for picking up signals in our rural area.  This phone has not dropped a single call yet.  Plus, it's got an incredibly long-lasting battery whereas my old phone had to be recharged every day, even when only used once during the day!  However, I can't carry it outside without #34;butt-dialing#34; everyone so I should have ordered a flip-top, which is what I had before. 	jakeg6	10-20-2015 11:41:15	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Display		false

66856468	This is by far one of the best phones I've had. First of all even though the 3D is not for everyone, it is fun to see people get excited and amazed when you show it to them.  I had the Sprint HTC EVO 3D and for a more specific review you can look into that review as the only difference is being GSM and the carrier specific bloatwear. Pictures are great and you can upload the 3D format into YouTube and share with others. The unlocked phone works great on ATT 4G (HSPA+ of course) and gets very good download and upload speeds. The processor and memory keeps up with most phones available to this date and the build quality is very good. Definitely recommend. 	belijah3	10-20-2015 12:23:20	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
65275637	I really enjoyed the phone when I first got it! It's great, it has a spacious keyboard which is great for texts and I really like the swivel screen. I would recommend the sidekick data plan because without it the phone isn't very fun (I don't have the data plan).The problems I had with the phone was that it's a little too big which is inconvenient at times, there's no touchscreen, and you can't customize the main screen with personal photos only the themes they give you. The phone is also a little outdated, it's a 2009 model so guaranteed it's going to be a little old. In a world where smartphones dominate, this sidekick has no touch screen and is not thin and small enough to fit in a pocket. It's a little bulky. I wish I would've looked into the size of the phone first.For the price, this is an awesome phone but if you want a phone that will last a long time I suggest a newer phone or model.No problems otherwise with the phone itself, calls are fine and quality is good. 	belijah3	10-20-2015 12:23:20	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	Upgrade	No Defect	No Defect		false

65643484	Alright, so admittedly the first one I got had an issue, which, it seems, is somewhat common from other reviews. The battery on it would die at around 10 hrs even without use and in standby.That was unacceptable for me so I contacted Izone and sent the phone back. I did have to pay to ship the item to them, which always irks me a bit, but I understand a company needs to make profit on a phone they're selling for a very reasonable price.I knew the phone was great (because I bought two and the wife is loving hers) and when the replacement finally arrived I was treated to a phone for Under $100 that plays most android games I can throw at it with no problem. **Shout out to Frozen Synapse if your looking for a turn based, reasonable tactical game to play against friends** and is running a version of the Android OS that none of the other phones in that bracket are updated to.It's responsive, solid battery life (after the return I was able to run 24hrs with some fairly heavy use during the evening), looks great, and just feels solid. I'm not worried about breaking it like I am a lot of the plastic options that are in the sub $100 price range.Overall nothing I can really say negative about it once the battery was solved. Well if I had to harp on one thing it would be the camera which is nothing special... but that's why I have a camera and not why I bought this phone 	belijah3	10-20-2015 12:49:34	Neutral	Performance Defect	Both	Replacement	Hardware	Software		false

There is nothing the iPhone can do that my new Galaxy Note 2 can't.You got to try the tablet capabilities for yourself because it alone will give you more features than you can ever use.A hint is to go online and look at some of he featured videos for this phone prior to purchasing it.I am a launcher critic for most cell phones but Samsung provided launcher is pretty good; in fact you won't get much more by changing to a new launcher.I thought this thing would be just too big because I carry my phone in my pants pocket, but I tried my daughter's Note 2 and it fit very well into the pocket. When I purchased mind I immediately put on Speck protective case and it slid in and out of my pocket with no problems at all.I've got to say that it looks huge for a cell phone but it works great functionally and physically.Checkout the positive reviews for this phone the negative reviews are people that will find a problem with anything and nothing is perfect for everyone. 	jakeg6	10-20-2015 13:09:31	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65485006	I love this phone.  It is built for business people, and functions flawlessly.  Easy access to Email, text, voicemail, retrieving files (via dropbox app) and a robust array of intuitive phone features are what matters the most to me and this phone kills it.  The incredibly seamless integration with Microsoft office (mail, mail folders, calendar and contacts) makes my life easy as all of these data bases are continually in sync and up to date, are all beautiful, and the option for FREE cloud back up for contacts doesn't hurt either.  The predictive type and auto correct you need to try to believe how cool it is.  I was expecting to convert to the Q10 with QWERTY key pad, but like the Z10's larger screen.  These business features alone would cause me to buy this phone; however, it also has a super fast browser, great camera and other toys to keep the professional occupied or in touch with friends. 	belijah3	10-20-2015 13:16:10	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66787150	The phone came in an excellent condition (brand new)one day before it was supposed to arrive.  The suggestions by PromoCell on unlocking the phone and installing Opera browser were not necessary as the phone came unlocked, and the browser was already installed. Instant messaging started working as soon as I inserted my SIM card, but in order to get an automatic voicemail box, I had to call ATT and they gave me a direct number, which I logged in. I agree with a prior reviewer who mentioned that the phone has a slow processor. I would also add that the WI-FI does not seem to work nicely, but the reason may also be the same: processor. Other than that, it is a pretty good phone for the price (I paid 129 dollars and 5 dollars for shipping and handling).

I checked other online services and none came anywhere near such a low price.I ordered the phone, and to my suprise I had it two days later even though I did not elect the extra expedited shipping option.  This was unbelieveable since it was shipped from California, and I live on the East coast!The ad for the phone on Amazon listed the item as 'new'.  When I received the phone, in the original box and was ready to activate it, I noticed that it had over 100 hours of use logged on the phone, even though the number had been removed and the phone was cleared for activation.  When I noticed this, I emailed the seller on the issue of it being listed as 'NEW' when it had usage logged on it.  I received an immediate reply back from them within the hour.  They explained to me that the phones were purchased in bulk from the manufacturer, as 'overstock', but some could have been on display, but had never been sold to anyone.  They offered me an instant refund of the purchase price PLUS the postage both ways if I wanted to return it (even though they have an 'exchange only' policy), or they would exchange it for another phone, and did have a new one in stock, that they would check to be sure it was indeed new.  They also sent a link to a site where I could compare cellular phones to each other to select another brand if I wanted to.  I elected the option of exchanging this phone for a like model that was new.  They immediately emailed me a prepaid shipping label to return the phone I had and said once I got it in the Post Office, they would ship out the replacement one, without waiting on the one I returned to get to them.  They did that and I recieved the phone two days later.The new phone was brand new and I immediately activated it and have had it for a couple of months and am extremely happy with this phone.  I didn't particularly want a Smartphone and had decided I would never pay the price for one.  I had chosen this phone in particular as it had a slide out full QWERTY keyboard that I was seeking. This phone was an Android one, and when I first activated it, it immediately downloaded the newest Android operating system.  I found that this phone did everything that the current ones on the market did and just as fast.  I became extremely interested in many of the apps available from the Android Market and learned all the features the phone had.  I have it loaded with apps that were either free or .99 at most.  I have downloaded everthing from different ringer tones, all types of games, an awesome grocery shoping list, an alarm clock that chimes on the hour during periods you set, etc.  I have a Bluetooth capable cordless home system and the phone is compatible with it and downloaded the complete directory into my home system.  I found OEM LG docking/charging cradle at Amazon for $3.95 that costs about $30 from Verizon.  It makes an excellent lighted alarm clock at night while the phone charges.I can't believe the low price of this phone for all the things it does, just as current ones on the market.  It has the full QWERTY slideout keyboard that is very easy to use.  It also has a virtual keyboard on the touchscreen that can be used either horizontally or vertically, and switches itself automatically depending on how you hold the phone.  I also found that it had speach to text which worked perfectly.  I don't need either keyboard, I just speak my text messages into the phone and who it is for, and the rest is handled automatically.  The new 'question' app available from the Android online market store free, works similar to the new IPhone 4S' Siri, that you speak to and it responds.  You speak to it, it answers verbally any question you ask it, as well as carries out many functions such as adding an item to my calendar, or look up an address from my directory and will text or email them!  Awesome!I love the phone.  And, I'm extremely happy to find a company like the seller 'JUST CELLULAR' that was so eager to please me immediately to my satisfaction, with the exchange of the phones.  They even followed up with an email to assure that I received the phone and was happy with it.  I've found VERY few companies with this kind of customer service unfortunately. 	belijah3	10-20-2015 20:17:40	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

80079037	This phone has 1 huge advantage over most new phones. 64Gb of space to use. You can use it on aapps or media. No one else has this. An extra SD card slot would have been nice but this is still fine. Someone said the screen was dim  and I find it to be bright if you make sure your settings are correct. It fast and dependable. The battery of course like most phones is ok but could be better. It does heat up but I have not seen it lockup or crash from it. I would recommend this phone to anyone. Its my first HTC phone and Im very impresed. I would say it runs as good as my samsung note 2.

As the price is lower than W810, I can compromise with the screen clarity and so-so camera. 	belijah3	10-20-2015 20:37:55	Comparison	Other	Hardware	Other	No Defect	Enclosure		false
64593584	I traded in my PSP for one of these to play games and watch movies.  I would have went for an I pod touch but their screen size (3.5) is just to small and hard on my eyes.  I am glad I took the 5.0 over the 4.0. But depending on you needs I would go for the 4.0 if your main pupose is to listen to music.~ Movies 3/5 stars~I bought this player mainly for movies on the go.  The big screen is great and pixel count is still very high.  The problem is buying movies and tv shows is hard to do.  This is where the Android market gets 1 star out of 5 for movies.  Yes, you can rent a movie (no tv shows though) from the Android marketplace, but it is stupid because you have to stream them.  You cannot download and save for a road trip or plane flight, or whatever.  You have to be connected to a wi-fi signal to watch your rental.  Which does not work for me.  What is the point in having a portable media player if you cannot watch your movies on the go?  Android can and should fix this by allowing you to download the rental just like the i-tunes store, psp store, and many other stores do.  Many people knock i-tunes.  I say they do it right.  They have movies, books, lots of games, apps, and music readily availible to sync to your player.  The problem with Apple is the don't have a 5 screen size pmp.I found a couple places you can actually buy Divx movies and download them but they are pricey (about 15$)just go to Divx.com, their selection is low and their are no tv shows.I have read a lot of reviews on the 5.0 and people have said that this device accepts just about all their personal music and movie files.  Don't be decieved by this statement like I was.  They have to be DRM free and/or unprotected.All i-tunes video files are protected (i-tunes music is not protected, if you bought it after 2009), all amazon videos are protected, all Zune videos are, all CinemaNow are too. Can you feel my frustration? Unfortunately the pmp with the large screen doesn't boast the best video playing capabilities due to my statements above.  However if you can get movies somehow (DRM free) on your player then you are set.~ Music 5/5 stars~This is where the large pmp excells.  Great playback.  Very good inboard speakers for their size.  You can broadcast local radio stations while you play games.  Very good included headphones, with the option of being able to listen to your music through Bluetooth.  How cool would that be (no wires).  I have had no problem transferring my entire music library (5-6 gBs) to my player.  I bought a class 10 micro sdhc 16gB Amazon card from Amazon.com, works great and is very fast uploading my music.  If you are wondering- no, I don't work for Amazon.~Games and other apps 4/5 stars~Android and Amazon have a pretty good selection of free to a couple bucks, games/apps.  I like the game Sentinal III, it is a good tower defense game.  Also check out plants vs. zombies on Amazon.com, this is my all-time favorite game.  There are lots of apps that you can preview on Amazon.com.~Navigation/GPS 3/5 stars~Does not seem to want to work without a wi-fi signal.  But according to other reviews if you download maps then you can use without wi-fi.  And it should because the player is supposed to have a GPS antenna built in.  I think that it is a little slower than a garmin ot tomtom gps though.  I downloaded a free app for adding voice directions to my GPS.~ Camera, still shots 3/5 stars~3.2 MP with flash.  The 4.0 does not include a flash.  But not a big deal, the pictures with the flash are not very good.  The regular pictures a pretty good.  The camera is extremely sensitive to light which can be good or bad.  Make sure you are facing away from the source of light.  The camera doesn't take very good action shots.  If there is any movement at all you will get a blur, so make sure your subjects stay still.  There are options to change to an action shot but I am sure you will be making the shutter time speed up, so you wil1 sacrifice image quality to capture something in action. The one thing about the camera that took me by surprize is the option to shoot a 8 shot panorama (180 degree shot).  This is very cool, the camera utilizes the positioning of the camera to get 8 perfectly aligned shots in a row as you slowly turn 180 degrees.  The camera guides you with arrows on the screen from shot 1 all the way to shot 8, then it pastes them together to form a cool panorama.~Back facing VGA Camcorder~ ..and a front facing, who knows what!eh, what can I say!  I don't know what the frame rate is but it's not very good.  The itouch has a 30 fps and other phones tend to have 24 fps (frames per second).  I looked video captured from the itouch and it was not very good.  The 5.0 is worse, (but the 5.0 3.2 mp camera beats the itouch's 0.8? mp camera).Again, the aperature is very sensitive to light and movement.  Which makes it hard to catch your subjects in motion. In my opinion the video camera is pretty crappy.  The only application I could see myself using it for would be video chat.~Web browsing~Is a pleasant surprise!  I tried using my Playstation Portable for web browsing and it was useless.  But the 5.0 is great for web browsing when you have a wi-fi signal.  I reccomend getting the Amazon MP3 Downloader App and utilizing the 5 gB storage space they give for free.  You can keep music and video and other files stored over the internet for free.  If you buy a song it will be stored on the cloud drive for backup, then you can directily download it to your player.  The cloud player also pulls up all your music stored on the device or you micro flash card.  Web browsing is pretty fast with the 1 ghz processor.  The player is synced with my gmail account so when I gat a new email I am notified.  It stores your latest emails and you can go to you gmail account and see all your emails (up to you last wifi connection) without being connected to wifi.~Overall~I recommend this player!  It is well built all around and the operating sytem is fine tuned.  The screen size puts it in a class of it's own.~Some other Cons~- Lack of inexpensive accesories (ie. gel covers).- Can easily be dropped.- Sometimes the I press on a link and it selects the one just above it. Minor issue.That's about it, hope I helped! 	belijah3	10-20-2015 20:37:55	Neutral	Performance Defect	Both	Other	Operating System	Internal Hardware		false

64144053	I'm an ATT fan for a long time and I own both I897 and I997. I897 is very similar to I997 in many ways except for the smaller screen and new body style. Both phone performs well on speed, screen quality and battery life. What I did not like about the I997 is the sound quality and low resolution. For having a bigger screen the amount of icons you can place on the screen are the same in I897, Basically the screen just got bigger not much sharper or better. Plus it's hard for me to carry the I997 in my pocket because of the size. What nice about the I997 is when you read txt, emails, and books because of the large screen. All in all I like both phones, I897 for games and other stuff and I997 for txt, emails, web and reading books. 	belijah3	10-20-2015 20:44:13	Other	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

67015546	PLEASE SEE NOTE AT END.After lots of reading and asking lots of questions, this behind the times Potato Head bought his first smart phone, a phone now encased in a pink flowery case and used almost exclusively by Mrs.Spudman the queen of the technophobes.In the box there was no owner's manual, so I found one on the web, downloaded it, and printed it. Using the manual Mrs.Spudman figured out how to configure her phone, add and delete numbers, used the camera, text, add aps, and do all those things that others mostly take for granted.The clarity of the screen is terrific with crisp text and graphics. Photos taken with the phone are not state of the art, but are certainly good enough to send via email and post on Facebook.One important feature for us is the speaker phone because Mrs. Spudman hates to hold the phone to her ear during those marathon phone conversations of hers. The sound coming from the phone's speaker is good, what one might expect from a cell phone's tiny speaker. Using bluetooth we sometimes use the phone with a wireless speaker for better quality sound. On a side note, the external speaker on our daughter's iphone is not better than that on the LG Venice.On a ten hour drive to Georgia we used GPS for the first time ever. Again the non techie Mrs. Spudman figured out how to set up and use the GPS which verbalizes directions with a pleasant female voice. The GPS is up to date and uses a Tom Tom system. The GPS feature is wonderful and got us to Georgia and back and helped us navigate around Augusta confidently. We had one hiccup on the way back home driving through DC. Not sure where th fault lay but we missed a turn and got lost on the city streets. Thanks goodness the GPS rerouted us and we were soon back on course. Can't imagine what we'd have done without the help of the GPS.We did notice that the battery lost power quickly on the trip until we plugged it into a power source in our car.  On our last night in Augusta Mrs. Spudman didn't charge the phone, so we had only 14% battery power for our drive. We kept the phone plugged in on the drive and by the time we reached our next destination, the battery power was almost up to 90%. We used  the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate Charger bought from Amazon. It's also a great product.Bottom line -  On the ten hour drive to Georgia we never lost our signal once. Boost has also been great, especially the diminishing monthly cost as long as one makes regular monthly payments on time. I like the phone so much that I WAS going to buy another one for myself.The internal memory on this phone has maxed out limiting what can be done on it. Also we got a message from Boost saying we'd maxed out our data usage. Mrs. Spudman spent an hour at Radio Shack with a helpful guy who got the phone to at least function better than a paper weight by deleting and moving stuff to the SD card.  He said the memory full problem is something he's been seeing with this model phone.UPDATE - Removing email has helped a lot with the memory glitch. 	belijah3	10-20-2015 21:54:32	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
65673928	My husband refuses to enter into this century's technology, so when he needs a phone it is difficult to find a GOOD flip phone. We have gone through several (at least 8) that lacked reception, in-call volume options, SUPER easy options. This one has it all!

37283110	Nothing to complain about the phone.  I love it especially the big screen!  It looks great and feels great.  Screen resolution is unbelievable.  Overall, I am liking the phone, but there are few things that prevented me from giving it a 5 stars.1.The absence of headphones from the package.  I don't get it.  Seems to be very intuitive, but somehow Nokia decided not to include one.2.Very easy to bring up bing search by accident.  It's just the way how the buttons are laid out and the touch sensitivity of the phone.  Even after I turned down the sensitivity to normal, it's still very easy to switch to bing search unintended.3.No mute switch on the phone.  You will have to turn the vibrate on from setting first, then press volume control, then you will be able to switch between vibrate and ring + vibrate.  If you want it to be just silent and no vibrate, then you will have to go back to setting and set vibrate to off.  Seems to be more work than needed.4.The screen does scratch easily.  I was being very careful, but I still saw fine scratch through light reflection after first day of use from fingers?5.This one derived from 4.  I tried to look for accessories (screen protector  case) for the phone at bestbuy, and I couldn't find any.  Amazon has some stuff, but very limited, too.  The only place sells Lumia 920 accessories  in store is ATT;, and you  know what that means, you going to pay premium over it.  The speck candy shell case is priced at 38, and screen protector is 25.  I needed the screen protector so I shelled out 25 + tax, and decided to go naked on the phone.6.Lack of apps.  Some apps is very important to some people.  My wife also got the phone, but when she found out that whatsapp is not available on windows 8 phone yet, she is not so happy.  I think microsoft needs to do something about it if they are serious about windows phone.The phone itself is great, but the lack of accessories and apps might hold people back from switching.  However, I have no regret.  I am very happy with the big screen this phone has to offer.  I can wait on everything else. 	belijah3	10-21-2015 11:50:03	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

No custom tones for texts/anything except ringtones.(are you F*** kidding mean)2. NO advanced WiFi settings of any kind. This means I can't connect to my university's network r any enterprise network. seriously? My girlfriends My-touch can do this with ease. My old iphone 3g could do this. THIS IS A BASIC FUNCTION3.

64440845	New Information added July 20, 2014CAVEAT EMPTOR: Let the frequent app installer beware:MY RATING IS STILL FIVE STARSThe LG Optimus Dynamic II (LG39C) Android Prepaid Phone with Triple Minutes is still a 5-star phone in my opinion, in spite of the problem that I relate below.WARNINGYou need to be careful how many apps, especially widgets, you download to your phone, especially if they reside in the phone's RAM (active memory) and run all the time. Even some game apps or utility apps that are not widgets stay in memory. Other apps, if properly written, only run when you start them, and quit when you exit them by backing out of them.I installed one too many widget apps to my LG Optimus Dynamic II LG39C smartphone, and ended up causing my phone to sometimes lock up and require me to reboot my phone. One of the memory management apps said I was only using 83% of my RAM, but I still had problems.I removed three widget apps, and have had no problems since. The fault was not the phone's. The fault was mine for being overzealous with the 1 GB of RAM memory that is in the phone.(NOTE that you can have as many properly written regular apps as you can fit on your memory card, as long as each of them exit properly when you finish playing them or using them. It's the programs that keep themselves in memory that eat up the RAM.)RATING AND RECOMMENDATIONI am not downgrading my five-star rating for this phone because the problem I had was due to my having too many programs on my phone. The LG Optimus Dynamic II LG39C smartphone is STILL a 5-star phone in my opinion, and I still heartily recommend it, especially to people who don't make a lot of phone calls, because TracFone has a good program that allows you to get enough minutes for typical low-end use without costing an arm and a leg as some providers charge.MY NEXT STEP - MY NEXT PHONE?I do miss the functionality of those glass widgets, and I love other programs, and want to write some of my own, so I am am looking for my next phone, and am leaning toward an android phone that is similar to one of theLG G3phones, if they ever come down in price that my budget can handle it, though I might settle for another android phone that has (or can be expanded) to 2 or 3 GB of RAM.I'm not willing to start paying the higher monthly bills to get the discount on the upfront cost, nor am I willing to go with the higher upfront cost to stay with TracFone, so I might have to do a lot of serious looking to find a 2GB or 3GB RAM android phone that is compatible with TracFone and compatible with my budget.================================MY OLD LG OLYMPUS DYNAMIC REVIEW================================Starting February 10, 2014, I went through the process of getting, being dissatisfied with, and returning several phones at Walmart.I started with a megaphone with an ATT; plan, but the monthly fee was just too much for my rural old-style programmer mind, and I thought the phone was uncomfortably big in my hand, so I switched to a Straight Talk phone with Android, but even that data plan seemed too expensive for me. (I'm 62), and somehow they disconnected my number (which might have somehow been ATT;'s fault), so ...I switched to a Star Trek style flip phone with TracFone, but quickly realized that I still wanted to learn some Android, so ...I upgraded to one of their Android phones, but sometimes, when I'd press one key on the screen, I would get a character from the other side of the screen, so ...I ordered this LG Optimus Dynamic II phone from Amazon, then went online to TracFone's toll-free number to move the number from one phone to the other, and though it took most of the day for TracFone CustServ to finish the job, it was done to my satisfaction.My only complaint is that I have to turn on the speakerphone to hear more clearly, but that's not LG's fault. After all, my ears are 62, also. (No, I haven't gotten a hearing aid yet, it's not that bad yet.) I did finally get thePanasonic KXTG7875S DECT 6.0 5-Handset High Quality Phone System with Answering Capabilitywhich lets me more clearly hear my calls when I'm home. See my Panasonic review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R309OWZLIXPDD3/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm==============NEW CONCLUSION==============added July 20, 2014If you old enough to be an AARP member, and if you don't make a lot of phone calls each month, but you do want to stay in touch, with phone calls, message texts, and limited Internet, then this is the phone for you. It works really well with TracFone, and since this is an Android phone, you actually get triple the minutes when you buy a refill at Walmart or at TracFone.com. (You also get triple that number of message units and triple that number of megabytes of Internet), which might sound confusing, but you get used to it. Buy a 120 minute card, you get 360 phone minutes, 360 texts, and 360 megabytes of Internet (data plan).If you sometimes have a month where you use it a lot, but most months your usage is much less, you can pay for three months at a time or even a year at a time. I paid for a year in March, and did have lots of usage when my motorhome burned due to faulty mechanic work in Pope County Arkansas. I suspect my overall usage will still come out much less than an unlimited calling plan with one of the big companies, and now that I've settled down, and bought a house in South Carolina, I expect my usage to average out to a low amount each month. In fact, now I don't worry about running out of phone minutes or megabytes of Internet, I worry that my message texts will run out first. 	belijah3	10-21-2015 11:53:43	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

49550905	I figured I would wait a while to review this phone. It is my first smartphone, though I had an iPod Touch before it. I was expecting it to be fast, and last a good amount of the day.The good:It looks absolutely brilliant. I love the design, and the phone feels so substantial. Friends often comment, even now, that my phone looks like it's new. The screen only has one or two scratches.The screen is beautiful. Images and videos are so crisp. And the brightness is great.It has 64gb of storage. I've so far used 15gb, and I love knowing I can store my whole music library on my phone.Their customer support seems excellent. I have only contacted them once, but I got a response THE SAME DAY! That's unheard of in customer support. The guy was really helpful too.The Bad:The battery life is abysmal. With 4g off, wifi on, and the screen on for about 1hr, my battery drops 40%. I did not expect anything amazing from the battery, but I thought it would be better than that. These are the results with #34;battery saver#34; on. With it off, the battery drains insanely fast.The speed. My friend's Droid Bionic is over 2 years old, and my quad core phone is choppier than his. We have tested this time and time again, and he beats my phone at simple tasks like opening and closing three programs quickly. Opening up chrome, opening up and sending a text. All simple functions I expect my phone to do without any lag. But there is always lag. In everything I do.Playing music is sometimes also an issue. Look around at forums and you will find this problem. Basically the audio gets really jittery and cuts out. When this happens, the whole phone becomes unusable for 5-20 seconds. The screen doesn't turn on, or if you are using the phone, it will freeze. This problem is rare, but it always seems to strike when I need to use my phone for something urgent.It heats up very quickly. Everyone I've lent my phone to tells me it is way too hot. I don't have to do much for it to heat up. Simple operations like playing music or browsing reddit will cause this. When GPS is on, the issue is exascerbated, but that is to be expected. What's unexpected is how hot it gets from just calling or texting. Two things that are not intensive at all.All in all, I would have given this phone 3 stars had it not been for the lag. That is completely unacceptable, and ruins the experience of having a portable work station. 	belijah3	10-21-2015 11:55:44	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

I was shocked when they answered Sprint Cancelations, can I help you? 	belijah3	10-21-2015 11:58:21	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	no defect with phone stated, just extra fees by sprint	false
26946315	I love how people complain about how thick and heavy this phone is compared to iphone or galaxy series. Then again, owners of iphone and galaxy series have to purchase thick and heavy phone cases in order to protect their phone from breaking if they were to drop the phone. Nokia users don't have to worry about this problem. Effectively, this phone is thinner and lighter than most phones out there because it doesn't need a heavy case. Nokia knows how to build a strong and useful phone.This is the best phone I ever held in my life and I was planning to pick between iphone 5, galaxy s3 and this phone. Eventually I ended up picking this one and I don't regret it at all. This phone is everything iphone 5 wishes it could have been. 	belijah3	10-21-2015 11:58:21	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
56205877	I just purchased this phone and it is by far the best phone I have ever owned. There are many reasons:1) Love the physical specs and how it fits in my hand. The 920 is very sturdy, and at 6.5 ounces, I actually like the weight of it. Some folks say it is too heavy, but I think it is just right.2) The Windows Phone 8 OS is fantastic. It allows for the most personalized home screen experience, much more than the IPhone or Android, which both seem cold in comparison.3) Kids corner is great for folks with kids. It allows you to have a 'kids' section that allows them to play games, listen to music, whatever you decide to allow. As a parent of yound kids, this will be fantastic for long car rides. They can't get into any of your mail clients or send texts.4) The camera is the best out there for smartphones, with an 8.7 megapixel Carl Zeis lens, with Pure View technology. Couple that with Optical Image Stabilisation and a 4.5 inch gorilla glass screen, the pictures and video are amazingly clear, especially in low light conditions. My kids play sports and it takes amazing action shots.5) Dolby sound lets me listen to music in style.6) Windows Phone 8 has plenty of apps, inclusing 46 of the top 50 best selling apps today on Android and IOS.7) Too many others to mention:)I just love this phone! Great job by Nokia and Microsoft for teaming up to make a best in class phone.  The biggest issue is it appears hard to keep this phone is stock. If you try this, you will love it. 	belijah3	10-21-2015 12:04:49	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
64555962	Not so heavy as the Samsung Galaxy Skyrocket (which was a good phone).  Excellent screen resolutions.  I got the white phone  paid out of pocket 279.00, didn't want to wait anoter year on my att; contract - att; should go to one year instead of 2 years.  Highly recommend this phone1/16/2014 UPDATE;  Well, I've had the phone since July 2013 and still like it.  Takes nice pictures  videos.  Screen resolution is awesome when having pictures of your grand daughters on the screen.  Sound quality good when talking on the phone.PRO:  The only thing that I don't like is that it doesn't hold a charge very well anymore.

Its unresponsive most of the time but when it decides to work its way to damn sensitive and you cant touch the damn thing without it opening every thing your finger gets near. Navigating the contacts list is a nightmare because of this and otherwise the interface is incredibly unintuitive. Wanna make a change in the settings section? Well all the little icons you dragged onto the 3 facing panels reset every single time you change something and you have to redrag them onto the 3 facing panels all over again....this phone is a pile of crap. Just get a damn iphone.Also ATT;'s app store is a freaking joke! ATT; mobile banking is apparently a social networking tool. Its also in every single other category under apps for some reason...WHAT A FREAKING JOKE! Myspace? Really? Where the hell is tumblr? or twitter? or anything that would actually be useful for someone under the age of 100 to use?! Well hell, we have myspace and yahoo search, what more could you want?

Another nice feature is that you can save favorite settings, etc. for the camera and quickly get to them (such as night or flash on always).  I've dropped it once and didn't find any scratches.

55725667	I've had my Windows Phone 8X since just after Thanksgiving. I was really excited to get it because it was so much lighter than the Lumia 920, and just felt better in my hand.My initial impression is that the phone feels _tall_. I put it side by side with an iPhone 5 and it's actually just barely taller, which makes me think it's just the narrowness of it relative to all the Nokias that makes it look so tall.  The only downside to the height is that the lock screen button is still on the top right corner, so it can be a bit far to reach.The body is a lovely soft touch coating, in a color I have affectionately named 'blurple', but HTC calls 'California Blue'.  I love when a manufacturer takes the extra initiative, and having the matching earpiece color and even the OS color is really impressive.  My only real complaints are that the buttons are so subtle along the sides that it can sometimes be hard to really push them- especially the lock screen which can be a bit of a reach for small hands.Inside, the 8X is blessed by pretty much the best Qualcomm hardware on the market.  It's wicked fast, never lags, and the OS is gorgeous when rendered on the vivid LCD screen.The only real reasons I've taken away a star are: high-ish price (with a Lumia 920 32gb running just 99, it's hard to compete), the hard to push lock button, and the fact that the soft touch on my corners has begun to wear down a little bit.I think this is a fantastic phone that you'd be much happier owning than literally ANY Android phone on the market. 	belijah3	10-21-2015 12:19:52	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

This was a perfect fit because she had the same one with T-Mobile and all I had to do was charge it, replace the sim card and that's it. The price was right and in todays market with most plans going to no contract and supplying your own phone, you will see more people buys phones for under $30 bucks rather than pay $600 for something that wont last a year! 	sanarauf	10-21-2015 12:48:12	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
64692436	I purchased this mobile since this will work globally by seeing the customer reviews. But later found it only work in US even though it factory unlocked. I tried to use my abroad SIM but it asks for SIM network unlock pin. Really I got cheated. But seller helped me a lot to resolve this but didn't worked finally and I decided to return it back. I am really felt bad. So customers beware check if the mobile is region locked which is something that Samsung has started doing recently. 	sanarauf	10-21-2015 12:48:12	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Replacement	Features	Software		true
65996659	Overall I would give this phone 3 stars. Unfortunately it would turn off by itself constantly even when the battery was fully charged. The only way that I could get it back on would be to remove and then reinsert the battery. The touchscreen would freeze several times daily which also could only be resolved by removing and then reinserting the battery. This phone has excellent features but crashes way too often and by that I mean DAILY! If it weren't for those issues, I would've been very pleased with this phone. Overall, most other functions worked well. 	sanarauf	10-21-2015 12:48:12	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Other	Operating System	Software	reinsert battery	true

66525091	I ordered and returned this item twice and am now on my 3rd phone. The first time the microphone didn't function. The second came with a cracked inside screen. Both appeared to have been refurbished and came in non-manufacturer boxes. The third came in the manufacturers box, but after 3 months the outer screen began to build up dust underneath and then eventually fell off, subsequently the inner screen became damaged. It was out of the warranty period for JustCellular, so I sent it to LG. They reviewed my case and determined the LCD screen was damaged because of me and could not fix it. While that is true, THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE THE OUTER SCREEN FELL OFF! They said that didn't matter, thus making a circular argument that because one thing failed in their phone it is still my fault because I broke the inner LCD! This is like saying the brakes went out in my car but I am responsible to the front end damage because I should have avoided the car in front of me. RIDICULOUS! Notably, their repair technicians/reviewers are paid LG employees, so there is a conflict in interest in who to blame for damage; they should use a 3rd party service. I will never buy an LG product again, their customer service was rude and terrible at best. 	belijah3	10-21-2015 18:07:22	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Internal Hardware		false

66781527	I love the RAZR. I have had one for years. I wanted an upgrade and selected the RAZR V3. The first phone delivered did not live up to RAZR standards. I contacted the company and worked with Erin, their rep.  I exchanged the phone at no cost to me. The new phone has excellent reception, I do not have to use the speaker for people to hear me (this was my main problem with the old phone). I also had a phone book problem which was corrected by the exchange.My suggestion to anyone who wants an inexpensive phone is to try this one. If it does not work out for you, call the company and give them a chance to fix the problem. If you would rather return the phone you will be offered a full refund.

65311539	I purchased this phone from the Tracfone website for 20 bucks with free Fed-Ex 3 day shipping, to replace my old, outdated  Motorola W260G. I like some of it's new features, however the phone has a glossy black finish, which makes it a finger print magnet, and VERY, VERY slippery. I dropped it twice before getting the battery installed and the phone fully charged. It's also hard to open, between the glossy finish, being so thin and having a poor design. I guess the fact that the phone still works after dropping it twice (so far) earns it an extra star. BE CAFEFUL when taking this phone out of your phone case (doesn't come with one) because it'll slip right out of your hands. The call quality seems OK, no complaints there. It's comparable to my Motorola Tracfone. I've used various Tracfone phones for many years, but I don't care for this model. Maybe I'm missing the big picture... sell phones that customers will drop/break/lose, and then sell them more phones! 	belijah3	10-21-2015 21:18:47	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	No Defect	Enclosure		false

64696565	I've had my Motorola Razr V3 now for 6 months.  I rely on it as my main business phone, I'm an attorney.  I've roamed with it around the USA, Turkey, Ukraine, Russia, Italy, Spain, and France.  Works fine.  What I don't like is the Bluetooth is too gimicky and the headset battery is short lived.  Not real intuitive how to seriously use the bluetooth.  My biggest gripe is it supports only simple call forwarding on/off.  My much cheaper Nokia supported call forward if busy/if not answered/etc.  The SMS message memory is way too small.  I've recently started to use the GPRS with the USB cable to my laptop.  The Motolrola Phone Tools is a disaster.

66574959	On Oct. 13, 2012, I bought a Galaxy tab 7.7 International version from Wireless Everything through Amazon for my wife. After less than 2 months of minimal use, it will not open despite attempts to charge it using both the computer and the wall socket. She then e-mailed Wireless Everything but did not get any response. After three e-mails, she reported the problem to Amazon. Unfortunately, Amazon will cover the buyer for 30 days only. Wireless Everything, on the other hand, refused to honor the warranty and insisted that we call Samsung because it is beyond 30 days. To date, we have a non-working gadget from a seller who sells a product and not be able to assist with any concerns regarding said item when it is still under warranty. I am very disappointed to say the least. 	belijah3	10-21-2015 22:52:41	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
66188611	Well, where should i begin?After long search in the market and reviewing at least 5 forums, and considering all my option for a good smartphone, i have stopped my search on HTC One X (this was prior iPhone 5 release, but it's release wouldn't change my pick). I'm beginning to study for my M.Sc degree, so i need a new phone with internet capabilities (i had Nokia 6230 before, i bought it in 2005, the best phone Nokia released for my opinion, but i have to catch up the digital gap somehow :-) )and one that can be used as computer too. First of all, i knew that I'll buy one that operates on android and not on IOS, i don't like Apple's iPhone because of it's concept (closed system). Secondly, i wanted the phone that i can keep for at least 3-4 years, so i wanted good processor, 1GB RAM memory, and at least 32GB internal storage memory, GPS. Other parameters like camera and blue-tooth didn't bother me. My pick choice was toggled between HTC One X and Samsung Galaxy S3. In that time HTC (international version!) cost was 540$, and S3 price was 600$ with almost identical parameters, so 60$ was in favor of HTC, i have picked him up.It's really good looking and well designed smartphone. It's battery life is like most smartphones, and barely enough for 1.5 days with common use such as internet or any kind of program.The problem started when i have downloaded HTC software update and after it's installation, it's gyro sensors stop to work. I have tried everything to fix it, including factory reset and safe mode calibration of the sensors before i wrote i have a problem letter to HTC tech support (i haven't mentioned that I'm electrics and electronics engineer, so i'm more than capable to fix those things). And what do you know? Although i have well described my problems to HTC techs and all the steps i have ALREADY done, they just replied to me to do what i have already completed, like it was some kind of bot replied and not a human being. After that, they had a nerve to close the case! After i contacted them again and wrote that they didn't helped at all, they offered me to send my phone for repair to their nearest Euro serving site, (that was Greece, by the way) for almost 25 euros and with all kind of limitations like i broke it in purpose. That was the answer i have received from their representative:Since factory reset did not solved the issue, We can book your device for a repair in our authorised repair centre. According to the global warranty of your device, we will send your device for a repair in our repair centre in Greece. A team in charge of booking the repair will contact you shortly in order to verify your details and schedule a pick up for your phone.A DHL courier will pick up the phone from your location. The shipping cost is 24.60 Euro which you will need to pay via a bank transfer ( not by any other payment method like paypal or credit card ). The repair time frame is up to 6 weeks, depending on parts availability.Should the repair centre will decide that your device is out of warranty ( physical damage, wear and tear or illegal software, unauthorised repair ), it will not be covered by warranty. The repair will be chargeable and we will send you a quote. Should you not wish to pay that quote, there will be an approximate 15 euros diagnosis fee to have the device returned to you unrepaired.Those words exactly. My first reaction for their reply was a though: are you for real?!I'm leaving it as it is for now. One thing for sure: i won't buy any of HTC products any more and i don't recommend to other people to buy from them too.As i said earlier, good product, crappy service. Maybe should spend another 60$ and buy S3, i'll never know! 	belijah3	10-21-2015 22:55:48	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

My only problem, which is probably more to do with Android phones or general trends, is that my old SIM card does not fit into this new phone. Instead of choosing to cut it, I opted for getting a brand new micro-SIM, i.e. two phone numbers now.Once they put out the new WIN/8 phones, I will see if they too use this new micro-SIM format.

65147776	This is our family's emergency phone.  We don't use cell phones regularly. I am very basic user who has no great cell phone or tech knowledge. I don't make or get many calls, and I use it mainly for texting.  It is a bit awkward to get used to which button combo to use to get certain characters. Sometimes I hit the wrong button and end up in the browser menu. The camera works fine, nothing fancy.  The back cover is easily knocked off. Battery life is fantastic. Easy to adjust the volume, too. I got it at a store so it came with a charger and a coupon booklet. I have not used any SD cards or other features or changed anything that can't be done right from the phone's menu (like ring tones).Without knowing much about these things, I like this phone just fine.

66963600	I purchased this phone less than 30 days ago and starting having problems after a week.  For example when using the phone the mute button will turn on for no reason and the other person cannot hear you.  Then when making a call using contacts, the phone will routinely dial a different contact four or five contact away.  When dialing a number the phone will place the call before you have finished entering all of the numbers.  The hands free device I use will not connect to the phone for no reason.  I tried another headset and same problem.When using the settings, the phone opens the wrong item even though the opened item is no where near the button you touched.  Boost will not allow a return since they only offer a refund/exchange within 3 days.  LG tells me to contact Boost and Boost tells me to contact LG.LG will not replace the defective phone only repair the phone.  From what I have read from others who had problems with their phone, LG does not fix or repair the phone you purchased.  Instead LG will send you a different phone that has been refurbished and you will not have a phone for at least 7 days.  Now I have to pay an another  $65 for the insurance deductible for a phone that was defective when it left the factory.If you purchased this phone and have had problems like I have right after you bought the phone, post a review.  Another attorney in my office thinks I can file a civil suit against LG and ask for class action status if enough people come forward with problems with the phone right out of the boxDO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!  There are several other phone that work much better some of the phone are more expensive (I which I would have paid $50.00 more and received a phone that actually works) and some are cheaper. 	jakeg6	10-22-2015 11:47:39	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Settings	Display		false
65373256	I received this phone from my brother (he used to work for Nokia in Texas) because my other phone broke (nokia 6102i) and my contract with Cingular was for another year (yeah, it sucks).Background: I was not eligible for the upgrade yet, so that meant I had to purchase a phone at retail price (without the contract) which would have run up upwards of $300 and more.  So I got this phone (unlocked) as a gift, and the switch-over was relatively easy and trouble-free.  I copied my address book from the 6102i onto the SIM card, and when I moved the SIM card to the 6126, the address book was there (taa-daa!).  What I was not able to move were the photos I snapped with the old phone.  Those I had to send via email, which I saved onto a microSD card and then was able to move to the 6126 (it has a microSD slot, which read the 1Gb card easily).Features:  I have always liked Nokia. This phone is no exception (except one which I will discuss later).  It is a clam (ie. flip) phone and is almost as slim as (but slightly lighter than) my Motorola RAZR. I like the menu layout of the Nokia. The camera is up to 1.3 Megapixel resolution (settings of 1,024x1,280, 960x1,290, 600x800, 480x640, 240x320, and 120x160).  The photos are decent in daylight, but not too great in poorly-lit areas (but that goes for every camera phone I've ever encountered).I like the black and silver coloring. No external antenna (sweet). The button on the side to open it is extra (not necessary). The internal display is nice and large, and colorful.  I like the navigation keypad. The textured covering on the rear flap is different (I like it, and is about 50-50 with my friends).There were plenty of hands-free features. There's a speakerphone, which is loud enough to be used outside, Bluetooth for connecting to a headset or for sending files, as well as voice dialing and commands.  There is POP3 and IMAP4 e-mail support, audio messaging for sending voicemails directly to another cell phone, and USB cable support (I haven't used this yet).There is a large 1,000-contact phone book has room in each entry for five phone numbers, e-mail and Web addresses, a job title and a company name, work and home street addresses, a birth date, etc. The SIM card can hold an additional 250 names.  Other extras include standard stuff: vibrate mode, text and multimedia messaging, calculator, voice recorder, a calendar with reminders, notepad, stopwatch, and an alarm clock.Hands-free features were plentiful, as well. There's full Bluetooth for connecting to a headset or for sending files, plus voice dialing and commands and a speakerphone. For hard-core emailers, there is also POP3 and IMAP4 e-mail support.I tested the quad-band GSM phone in San Francisco/Bay Area using my existing Cingular wireless service.  I got the same quality as the old Nokia 6102i phone.  Call quality was decent.Now, for the negatives.  A minor drawback with the design is that the MicroSD card slot is located behind the battery cover.  Although, you don't need to remove the battery itself, but you do need to remove the cover. My other beef is with the battery life.  The 6126 has a rated talk time of 3.4 hours and a promised standby time of 10 days.  When I maxed out the talk time, I got about 3.5 to 3.75 hours talk-time (impressive).  Because I am always on the phone, it is hard to guage the standby time.  However, when I paired and activated the Bluetooth, and connected with a Nokia BH-900 earpiece (By the way, the BH-900 earpiece is sub-standard compared to the Motorola HS850, but that is another review altogether) that is when I got a feeling about the battery life in standby.  For half a day of minimal use (20 min max), and standby the rest of the day my battery is now at 20-25% capacity.  When I turned off Bluetooth, I was able to go a full day with some use and still have over 50% battery capacity.  So it seems that when the Bluetooth feature is activated it is eating up more battery juice (which makes sense).  I have yet to find a control that tells the phone to automatically turn off Bluetooth when there is no active device around.Conclusion:  The Nokia 6126 is a nice phone with many features.  I only gate it 4-stars because of the battery life.  This is a must, especially for a frequent traveler (like me) or those who use the phone/Bluetooth earpiece a lot.  Nokia has to improve on the battery life, and this is easily done with a patch to automatically turn off Bluetooth when there are no Bluetooth devices around. 	jakeg6	10-22-2015 11:47:39	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Camera		false

For me, this phone offers a great balance between functionality and fun.  As a plus, it has one of the most beautiful screen resolutions I've ever seen in a phone.  Absolutely love the way Windows 8 Live Tiles perform - move them, shuffle them, resize them, delete them.  Watch them update with new info, too.  They are so easy and intuitive to use.  Adding a new app? ... then just add a new tile on the main page or let the app reside with others sorted alphabetically on an adjacent page that is just a finger push away.  This phone is very efficient and fun.  Very cool features with camera apps - Try Smart Shoot, Creative Studio, Cinemagraph, and PhotoBeamer.  Also, the phone came pre-loaded with Office Word and Excel.  Thank you!  One more plus, among the many others I'm still discovering, is not having to physically plug-in the phone to charge it.  I just place it on the wireless cradle that stays plugged in at home.  Somehow, it charges wirelessly without any metal-to-metal contacts.

I personally love the Nokia Lumia line I carried the 900 which was a good phone but Nokia made huge improvement with this second generation as did Microsoft with the 8 OS. The camera is great every bit as good as the iPhone 5 and I use my xbox so the extensions for xbox music and the xbox glass app is really great and pretty cool. Tap and share NFC is awesome. Rooms for my fellow peers is a great app built into the OS and to sync up and share calendar events pics docs I cant tell you how that saves time and very convenient. Nokia Music is a great service for free and being able to save the music is just amazing nobody does that very unique service and Nokia Drive is the only GPS that after you download the map you need no network coverage to use the service and it is global too. If you like the customization of Android but the closed garden of apps that provide security and fluidity between devices Windows 8 is for you and you definitely should buy this phone. 	jakeg6	10-22-2015 12:07:26	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66989796	Pros: great all the way except...Cons: The phone does not have a vibrate mode. My father in law is very hard of hearing and does not hear the phone ring, even when it is in his pocket. I have never seen a phone before this one, which is touted as being a safety device, that came without a vibration mode. This is a big Con in my book, 	belijah3	10-22-2015 12:47:36	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Features	Internal Hardware		false

64876634	I had the Samsung A600 for awhile which is absolute doo doo.  You can read my review on it and detect my rage at the stupid thing.  It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1.  I wonder y she sold it so cheap?...Bad:  ===&gt;  I hate the menu.  It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly.  Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go.===&gt;  It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate.  If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately.  There's no fast way to silence the damn thing.  Always remember to put it on silent!  I learned that the hard way.===&gt; It's so true about the case.  It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process.  Also, you'll damage the case each time u try.  For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it.===&gt; Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger.Good:  ===&gt; Reception is not too shabby.  I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket.===&gt; Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well.  The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life.  It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos.===&gt; Nice bright, large screen.===&gt; Cute ways to customize it.  Scroll bar can be set to purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc.Overall:  Okay phone.  It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint.  Why get so so when you can get great? 	belijah3	10-22-2015 12:47:36	Comparison	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Enclosure		false

65786790	I really like this phone.  I bought it because I had work in South Africa for 3 months and needed something that I could put a local sim card in.  I like this phone so much that I think I will keep it and use it when I get back to the States.-Calls are both reliable and clear which I think is the most important thing(it is a phone first after all)-The keyboard takes some getting used to but I think I now prefer it to either a qwerty(takes up too much space w/ too small of buttons for fingers like mine), a touch screen(same finger problem) or a regular keypad.  I don't have excessively large hands but I def do have man hands so I find many things are not built with me in mind.  If this is not your case then you can disregard this part but I find that many of the men I work with and my friends tend to have similar issues.-I didn't really want a flip phone either but now that I have one I am becoming a fan(no pocket dialing or key locking etc.)-Battery life is good.  I turned on the music player and left it on speaker to see how long it would take to drain the thing and after 4 hrs and less than half the battery gone gave up.-Camera isn't that great but is more than adequate for a phone like this.-I like that I can turn off data services and keep wi-fi on so that I don't get clipped in the US for a blackberry plan and can still use data from wi-fi(obviously not as great if you don't have regular wi-fi spots but if data is that important to you then you can always purchase the plan)-The screen isn't that big(it is more than adequate though)  It is bright and crisp-Interface is good and I like having a smaller phone with the blackberry ball-Music production quality is really good and doesn't drain the battery(see above) plus the ability to expand the memory is nice.-Basic memory included is really not adequate if you are going to actually use this as a blackberry or music phone but I picked up a microSD 4gb for less than $10 and am so far happy so plan on buying a card-Phone seems pretty durable but I haven't had it that long so I will update this as I go-I have read some reviews about the phone being to slow or not working etc. I think this is prob a hardware issue that would be covered as long as you buy one with a warranty.  I think it is also the effect of the 1 in 1000 customers who get a bad phone to be unhappy enough to write a review while 999 ppl who are content won't.-This is NOT a smartphone but it does do what you need it too.  Personally I don't want a phone that is too big just so I can do inadequate work on it.  I can do the basics of what I need to while on the go and if I need to do something serious I will sit down and pull out my laptop.  That is my preference though.All in all a great phone for a reasonable price.  I would highly recommend it to anyone either traveling or just looking for an unlocked phone in the U.S. 	belijah3	10-22-2015 12:49:32	Neutral	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Enclosure		false

65313596	This unit has a great display and good reception (I'm in a fringe area). My only complaints are with the connections. The proprietary charging and earphone connection has a flimsy and clumsy port cover. Holding it out of the way while inserting a connection is a two-handed and sometimes difficult operation. I'm tempted to just clip off the cover, which will probably come off soon by itself. As noted in other reviews, the unavailability of a standard earphone port makes the nice mp3 listening option almost moot.All in all, though, as a phone and for the deal offered at Amazon, I can certainly recommend it. 	belijah3	10-22-2015 12:55:18	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	No Defect		false

66364549	i'm going to be short with my review, just going to list the things I didn't like about the phone.1. There was a bug where the phone's screen would show a LOT of pixelation when it's viewing something very dark. Basically you'll see black and dark gray squares everywhere. It should be a software issue, but it annoyed me a lot.2. price, i just couldn't justify owning a $600 phone.3. the s-pen is really useless unless you play draw something a lot.4. when holding the phone for long periods of time (youtube videos), my hands get really tired if you grip it with one hand. for me, i like whipping my phone out at times with one hand to check some stuff out quickly, this phone is NOT meant to do that. ideally it must be held with both hands, which really limits multitasking.5. there is a very noticeable shutter lag in its camera.6. slow update to ICS, still not out as far as I know.7. plastic design, don't know why samsung loves plastic that much.i'm not hating on the phone, I think it's a great phone, but just not for me. 	belijah3	10-22-2015 12:57:47	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Camera		false
65974448	This phone is a good phone for keeping up with emails, and making calls, and texting.  After about a month of owning this phone, it would freeze up and take about three minutes to open a text, and if you were unlucky (like I was a lot) you would have to wait another few minutes before it let you input text in the message.  This phone also has an awful GPS navigation system in it.. It is a great back-up phone, but you are better off with a newer smart phone that is on the market. 	belijah3	10-22-2015 12:59:31	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64818883	Been using my Nokia 603 for over half a year thus far. Would not give it up for any other phone on the market for the balance of security vs. features it offers!Lots of solid features in this phone at this price range. Exceeds what you can get vs. any other phone out there when balancing out features vs. security vs price.Screen is amazingly bright! In a direct comparison with the iPhone 4S, with both the 4S and 603 turned to maximum brightness, the 603 easily matches the 4S and is perhaps a touch brighter. Certainly, the 701 has an even brighter 1000 nit rated display, but these phones are already bright-enough to see clearly in direct sunlight.Here, the messaging covers all available types - SMS, MMS, voice messaging, email - as well as the ability to download attachments and include attachments of any type. Built-in QuickOffice allows you to read Office documents and PDFs, while an inexpensive upgrade allows for full editing. Opening PDFs of 300+ pages pose no problem at all, and scrolling through such ebooks is quick and easy due to the fast CPU. Later, in an upcoming release of Belle this year, Microsoft Web Apps will be fully integrated as well - quite exciting! The built-in text-to-speech allows you to have the phone read texts to you if you so choose. And ZIP program lets you open up *.zip attachments.Email allows for IMAP, POP and connectivity to common webmail services such as Yahoo! Mail. Naturally, it's a one-stop service that allows you to easily integrate multiple accounts into one handy mailbox to check on-the-go. Threading and non-threaded views are available depending your preference, too.The built-in web browser handles most websites without a problem and the built-in Flash Player allows you to visit many streaming video sites that you cannot with other phones that lack such. The popular YouTube videos open up in the built-in video player full-screen, and Flash web advertisements can be seen across various sites.Of note, the free YouTube Downloader app instantly lets you surf across YouTube and download any video in 360, 720, or 1080 formats to your memory card! When used over a WiFi connection, you can load your phone with videos to watch on-the-go and avoid expensive 3G data charges. An extremely convenient app that is a must-have for any heavy video nut!Additionally, the free Nokia Internet Radio app allows you to play all of the streaming Shoutcast and other standard online radio feeds all day long. Quite nice when you've run out of FM radio options.The Nokia 603 uses a hyperfocal lens, meaning it is set so that everything from about 50cm to infinity is in sharp focus.The single disadvantage is that when framing something smaller than a standard piece of paper, the images will be fuzzy. Thus, when you attempt to take photos of small objects, you must keep your distance and crop later.The big advantage is that you do not ever wait for the camera to focus ala slow iPhones! Since everything is always sharply focused from 50cm out, you can take photos as quickly as the phone allows, and move about when taking videos while not worrying about unfocused subjects. This is a very nice feature for most users and takes that problem of fuzzy focus away from blessed 603 users.The white balance is generally very good - sunlit koi in ponds to snaps of buildings and people come out as expected - contrast, sharp, richly colored, vibrant. Slight shifts indoors and at night, but still quite accurate and realistic. Both video and photos are sharp enough to replace an iPhone 3Gs with (which also has a 5MP camera), so no worries here.Videos are recorded at 720p at ~12,000kbits/second H.264/AVC, which is more than sufficient for nice-looking video recordings. Zooming is allowed during videography by pressing the volume buttons or on-screen controls. The zoom moves smoothly through the fine steps, so you can easily frame without much worry.The usual slew of mapping features are included. Search, 3D mode, terrain and satellite, night view, walking and driving naviagation with a slew of voice languages to pick from for voice navigation prompts.GPS, A-GPS, WiFi, cell tower, etc. methods are are available for triangulating your position, and each can be turned off to save money or power. Signal lock with cellular assist takes only a dozen seconds at most.Maps for almost all major travel destination countries in the world are Free and can be downloaded using your computer or the phone to memory for offline use forever. Naturally, a 16GB+ MicroSD card is recommended due to the large map size if you choose to download multiple locations. Quite nice since you do not have to pay any money for data usage once maps are downloaded at one go.In the end, an excellent upgrade from a 5230/5800/etc. S60 5th, and one of the nicest smartphones available that's packed with many free, useful features, some that are not available on other platforms. A reasonable $220-240 USD price point. The Nokia 701 does add an 8MP camera, FM Transmitter, and a 1000 nit display, but certainly nothing most would miss with the Nokia 603.Naturally, if apps are your main focus, an Apple iPhone will be the best choice with the largest app store around.Apple's solid commitment to providing three generations of OS upgrades for iPhone buyers is great (ie. 3Gs started with iOS 3, then got 4, and now 5), and Nokia does a good job at providing updates for 2-3 years after each model has been released.Thus, if you use your phone mainly for the basics noted, and not dilly-dally with games, the Nokia 603 an excellent choice for those upgrading from older Symbian models and even other platforms for the added benefits (FM Radio, MicroSD card slot, Free GPS voice navigation and maps, 16:9 ClearBlack display, dragdrop; media, security). 	belijah3	10-22-2015 13:01:14	Neutral	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Internal Hardware		false

64467194	I've had this phone for a year and will tell you it has been a pain and here's why. The navigation button is very easily pushed by accident and gets you to the internet (browser) where your air time is being eaten. In order for that not to happen, you HAVE to lock it which takes two buttons to do and two presses to undo. By the time you need it or try to answer a call, seconds have passed and you've lost time. But they make it easy for an accident to eat up your minutes and that's happened every single time I buy a card. Only the last two times, it did it so that I had many more service days than minutes PLUS it ran out of airtime at a very inconvenient time - luckily, right AFTER my car died and I needed to call a friend and have them come jump the battery. If it had run out a minute sooner, I'd have been stuck on the side of the road. I attribute it to God that the second scenario didn't happen. And it ran out because the button had gotten pushed by accident in my purse and internet (that I wasn't really using and never do) ate up all my minutes. IT almost wasn't there for me in an emergency. What if I had broken down in a crime-ridden neighborhood instead of somewhat close to my own home and friends??? Anyway, I got this phone for emergencies and only wanted to pay $15 a month. The last two months though it has run out of airtime way before the days of service BECAUSE of its poor design and the internet getting accidentally knocked on. Poor design, folks. So I called and told them I wanted some air minutes refunded or I'd pitch the phone and get an iPhone, because if I'm going to spend $60 on a phone every month, I sure as heck am not going to use this phone (you can barely see the letters and you have to press two buttons to get many of the functions you use every single sentence of texting). I'm going to get a phone that offers a LOT more!!! So first I get Felicia who stonewalls me with that I can't refund you any airtime. Finally, with my persistence that she should, she sends me on to her support team which just gave me a snappier-voiced support person named Shamika. She had a very rude edge (I guess she's paid the big bucks to stonewall me even more) in her voice but finally relented and said she'd give me 20 minutes more airtime. She said I was welcome to pitch the phone in the trash. And of course, she said I could lock the phone so it doesn't get accidentally pushed, but she would not acknowledge my suggestion that the internet should take two presses of buttons, not the lock, which is a SEVERE inconvenience. Also she would not acknowledge that most users would not use this crappy of a phone for the internet. It sucks up minutes! Why would anyone do that? They'd buy an iPhone if they wanted to use it for internet, or at least a Smart Phone or droid phone. Plus battery time sucks on these phones. Nothing recommends this phone except that you pay as you go and you can spend only $15 a month if you use it just for calls and texts. But if it doesn't work that way because they found a way to accidentally suck up your air time, what's the point of having one? Perhaps they just make a lot of money off idiots like me who buy and don't read reviews first. I am now WARNING YOU as I wish I'd been warned, don't buy this phone. Invest your money in a better phone. Go where you can be helped by a PERSON (a store, like Cricket maybe? or a Verizon booth or ATT booth at the mall) and ASK: how do you get to the internet. If it is really easy to accidentally get your phone to a browser, THINK TWICE. It's a way of sucking up your money by accident - and accident they can throw back on you so they don't have to refund any of your money or airtime. Look for one that takes a little work to get to the internet. Because even if you DO use the internet, like I don't, you don't want your airtime being sucked up by its accidental access. You want it there WHEN YOU NEED IT, and it almost wasn't there for me yesterday when my phone died. Luckily the first person I called answered and came to help me. Otherwise, I could blame Net 10 for a really bad day and being stuck without help, which is WHY I bought the phone in the first place. With 20 minutes refunded airtime (not very generous) I have enough airtime to call all my friends and tell them: I'm done with this phone. Done with this company. DONE so await word for my new cell number or this one being switched to a different phone company. 	belijah3	10-22-2015 13:51:42	Comparison	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Display		false
23887142	I absolutely love this phone. I ordered it new and received it in mint condition. This phone is great to use if you're having to write several essays or if you use an Xbox and want to be able to gain achievements while away from home. I did receive it brand new so at first the phone appeared to be glitchy, but after I installed 4 rounds of updates it has worked flawlessly. This is a European version of the phone which I believe is set in French as the default language. Also, the charger that is supplied with the phone is made for a Europe outlet and it has an adapter piece that will allow you to use it in the US.I'm very pleased with this purchase. 	belijah3	10-22-2015 13:51:42	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
64285291	Great item; but you have to get use to its size.  Works well, but you my have a problem finding a sim card for it.  But you can find a sim card cutting template on the internet.  So service providers will cut one for you if they don't sell them already.  With that issue out of the way I am sure you will be more than happy with the unit.  Note that many of the apps for this unit can be downloaded for free.  That being sad remember that music, photos, data files, and apps eat up the phones memory and battery; invest in an additional battery if you are using the phone to do more than make calls and you will.  Also consider getting no less than 32GB of additional memory. 	belijah3	10-22-2015 13:53:26	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

Also, one of the iPhones had a non-functional battery, which, again I had to buy with my own money back in home country and have it changed. I thought the extra $$ I was paying contrary to other iPhone 3g deals on Amazon would be worth it, but it wasn't.The only good thing I'd say is that the iPhones, although used, looked pretty much new. 	belijah3	10-22-2015 13:53:26	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Internal Hardware		false

38538821	Bought the 8GB unlocked Nexus 4. Activated it with T-Mobile. Phone worked great except it had problems receiving text messages. Friends would text me but the phone never received them. Tried a new sim card but that didn't seem to help. Took it to the T-Mobile store and they didn't know what else to do other then switching out the sim card and playing with a few settings. Nothing seemed to work. Switched to a galaxy s 3 and love it.A couple other points I will make. I bought the phone for my wife, but the stock android on the nexus 4 certainly isn't as refined or pretty as the customized Android you find on the GS3 for example. So for hardcore users, the stock android experience is probably fine, even desirable, but for my wife she hated it because it wasn't as user friendly for her. Got her a GS3 instead as well.Price is certainly right for the Nexus 4 and no contract with T-Mobile is the bomb.Technically, the nexus 4 is capable of 4G LTE on T-Mobile but you need to root your phone and install a developer's OS and change your radio settings. But it works if you are technically savvy. Many articles on developer websites on how to do this. However most people, don't have the knowledge to do this and frankly the jump in speed from HSPA+ to LTE isn't all that meaningful for your every day user. 	jwilets	10-22-2015 17:32:21	Comparison	Performance Defect	Both	Other	Hardware	Internal Hardware	Comparison of Devices	false

On the second day I started to notice that some incoming messages weren't coming through, I look through setting and couldn't find a fix. the problem got worse after the second day, I could receive messages, make/receive calls but only when ever the phone felt like it, it would not receive messages and it never did, I ask my friend to send those failed messages to my brothers phone and he got them right away, But not my phone. It got me mad so I called Verizon to get the phone fix. they said the problem way the device so they send me a supposibly new phone and it had the same problem, I called them again and now they are diagnosing it again.

36494177	The biggest downside of this phone is the small app market and there is a version of every app I ever really used on my two previous phones. I owned an Iphone 3Gs (which I liked) and replaced that with a Motorola Atrix (which I liked also for different reasons but it was glitchier than the Iphone) and this is my favorite of the three. I was looking for a new phone because the Atrix was getting really slow and it was between the 920 the Galaxy S III and the Iphone 5. I've played with the Iphone 5 and it's nice and I would have been more than happy with it but the Home screen isn't as good and I actually like the heftier phone. The android was nice because of all the customization but after about a day I didn't do much with it and I had more problems syncing with my computer than my Iphone. The only caution I give on this phone is it seems it mightbe hard to use if you have small hands but maybe a smaller handed reviewer could comment on that. I'd buy this phone again in a heartbeat and the more people that buy it, the better the app marketplace will get. If the rating was out of 10 I'd give it a 9. It's not perfect, but it's pretty close. 	jwilets	10-22-2015 17:37:08	Comparison	Other	No Defect	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software	Comparison	false

So much for rough and rugged.Now at the one year mark, the earpiece stopped working. It only has sound from the speakerphone speaker.

66493480	I bought a windows phone this week and I must say that I was literally amazed by its speed and its touch and feel due to the rubber back that allows you to grip it very well. I took the black and white version that I liked much more than the blue.  I was amazed by its simplicity and above all for its cleanliness installing the application and then how easy you find them again, I really like the system to tiles that is much better on a mobile phone on a PC. The battery lasts more than a day with intensive use with push notifications and wifi always on. The only drawback may be the only 4 GB of storage space although for photos videos and music you can use a sd card. For me this thing is not a big problem, since I don't use maps or play with games. I installed eighty applications and space is almost full, but for what I need is really fantastic. In my opinion much better in terms of use of any Android. I'm really super satisfied. And last thing when you hear the music in the headphones is really another music thanks to Beats Audio. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 15:14:52	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64281178	Below is my review of the 16GB model that I purchased in September. The two models are completely identical with the only exception being the additional 16G of storage space. Performance is totally unaffected by this....... Please note that this is strictly my opinion of the phone itself, I have no knowledge of this seller or the condition of the phones they sell.I had the 8GB 3G model and thought that was great, until I got a demo of the iPhone 4. Man is this version is light years ahead of the original model.With a 1Ghz CPU, and 16GB of flash memory, this thing is a portable office/entertainment center par excellence. I've had this phone for 3 months without a single problem, the display is nice and sharp, the apps load very fast, and I now have over 130 apps to perform just about every duty you could possibly think of with absolutely no impact on performance. And on the ATT 3G network, I average download speeds of around 1.8Mbps, and over 1M upload speeds....and how do I know that, cause I got an app that tells me that's how. BTW, the display is the equivalent of a 960x640 on your desktop (double the 3G model) so what you see is essentially a high res yield and page loads are superfast. And resident memory, after a full days use I just checked and still had 120Mb of Ram available. On the 3G model that number was usually down around 4Mb by the end of the work day and had to be refreshed.I was in the computer/design/manufacturing business for 20 years, and this is by far the most amazing piece of technology I have ever seen or imagined. Even the battery life is 3x better than the previous model, and thats a good thing cause its integrated but a full charge should yield and entire days work of calls, emails, surfing the web, SMS messaging, and play. I no longer need my laptop cause there's nothing I cant do with the iPhone, and that includes sending faxes, editing Excel or Word documents, and even printing. A flash for the 5MP camera, an HD video camera, and even real time video conferencing over a wireless network, and Bluetooth that unlike the 3G model is actually compatible with everything you throw at it, including Garmin GPS....just amazing. This thing even has 2 mics with noise suppression so calls are clearer on the other end. Man, Apple hit this one out of the park.BTW, with all the apps, music, and videos I've got loaded on this thing I've still got 10GB of flash memory remaining. I cant imagine why anybody would need more storage, and the 32GB model isn't any faster and doesn't have any more features. You'll need iTunes on your desktop to get the most out of this phone and iTunes can be a little intimidating at first but its worth the trouble, and all the instruction you need can be found on the web or Youtube for transferring photos, videos, music, apps, etc.Update 12/09/10: I've been reading up on the antenna problem with the iPhone 4G and have this to say.... It is easily cured by slapping on a hard case or shell on the phone, which eliminates the issue I see some people complaining about. I have personally never experienced this issue because I left the ATT; store with a protective shell on my phone which virtually everybody I've ever seen with an iPhone has anyway. Very simply you CANNOT replicate the reported death grip problem with a shell around the outer frame. Cant be done. And BTW, I don't know if its due to network improvements or what but lately I'm getting 4Mbps download speeds so if anything I'm happier with my purchase now than I was 4 months ago. Zero complaints, and that's something most smartphone users of other OEM products can't say.A final word: Beware negative reviews on here that are filled with bad English and are authored by individuals who have written only one review (on the iPhone) and posted it in several locations on Amazon's site. Its easy to pick these out, and they have no doubt been written by the same person. See the comments section for a definitive review on the Iphone 4 and the overblown antenna issue from Anandtech.comA final final word: Apparently this phone from Worldwide Distributors is LOCKED! If you plan to use this phone outside ATT;'s network you are screwed. All the one star reviews are from idiots that paid $800 for this phone without doing proper due diligence.Oh wait, I do have one complaint about the iPhone 4. Several times a month my girlfriend gets mad at me and hangs up in the middle of the conversation so I guess I'm suffering from this dropped call thing after all. haw haw 	jwilets	10-25-2015 16:53:00	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66697147	Pros:  Touch screen with QWERTY keyboardCons:  No spell checkI've had this phone now for three years.  I've dropped it, kicked it, and splashed it with a bottle of water.  I have fat fingers so I love the QWERTY instead of the touch screen keypad.  I dread knowing that almost all smartphones have gone to touchscreen only.  I was disappointed in knowing that it doesn't have a spell check and yes I've checked and called Samsung.  I just had to make sure of what I had typed out before hitting send.  The original battery finally died and wont hold a charge for longer then a few hours this last week.

1700624	I purchased a phone from this company. Worst mistake ever! When I removed the phone from the box and turned it on, the screen came alive in Arabic. The charger was for use in Europe, not North America. There was no contact information in the box or the invoice so I looked up the company on Google. Their website gave a phone number which I called. The guy who answered the phone was less than helpful and told me to contact Amazon. I called Amazon, they told me to contact the seller. There I sat with an Arabic phone that I had no idea what to do with. I called Nokia. There tech took almost an hour to solve the problem and then it was more luck than skill. Finally changed the language to English and proceeded to setup the phone and then remove all of the Arabic apps and links. The phone worked fine for three days and then started freezing up. Again less than no help from the seller. I am returning the phone to them and have purchased a replacement from another seller through Amazon. Only being a good Amazon customer has saved this bad experience. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 20:10:15	Complaint	Unable to Use	Hardware	Other	Hardware	Internal Hardware	Contacted Amazon	false

I was told the phone they are currently shipping has only 4 GB of memory, yet the price is the same as advertised for the 8 GB phone.  I guess this an improvement over the 2 GB phone another reviewer received lt;g&gt; but is still not the phone that is listed on this Amazon storefront.Since this appears to not be a new problem, I suggest it is time for Amazon to give this outfit (Worldwide Distributors) the boot or at least make them clean up their act. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 20:20:47	Complaint	Other	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	Company issue	false

82302552	This phone seems cool at first glance.  The construction is definitely solid, the screen looks great, and it feels nice in ones hand.  Once you start using it, however, you will realize it is actually like a Ferrari that has had its engine pulled out and been filled with garbage, manure, and raw fish scum.  First, there are no apps for this phone.  None that you would want to use anyway.  The apps that do exist are poorly made and barely work.For example, the map application couldn't direct its way out of a paper bag.  If you try to go from Atlanta to Charlotte using this application, you'll probably end up being held hostage by a Japanese street gang.  Another example is the battery app.  The makers of this phone thought it would be too predictable to put a way to tell battery life on the home screen itself, so you need to get a third party app.Lets say you're going to bed, and want to decide whether to charge your phone or not.  You look at your battery app's live tile, and it says 76%, so you decide to just place it on your night stand.  Inevitably, the next morning, you wake up an hour later for work with a dead phone.  No alarms ever went off, and wonder what the hell happened.  Its because your battery app live tile said 76% when it was actually at &gt;10%, because the live tiles update less frequently than an encyclopedic volume of Medieval Muscovite Music. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 20:21:49	Complaint	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

It continued for some days. I did the factory reset and it got fine but again started.  Then the headphone stopped working. I tried to manage even without headphone. Then slowly a new problem started - The phone started giving trouble while charging. It continued for few days and then it does not charge at all. I tried all different chargers. But it is not charging. I spent almost $300 for the phone and it did not even last for 5-6 months. I am not rough user of phone. My uses are hardly 20-30 minutes each day.

39687065	If you hate navigating automated phone services as much as I do then this is the phone for you! As soon as I place a call the screen instantly goes black so I don't have to try to work through a series of numerical prompts. I can just sit back and scream obscenities until an operator picks up and connects me with whomever I need to speak.  Brilliant!But what if the automated service doesn't respond to my voice, you ask?  Not to worry! Once the call is connected it's impossible to hang up, and thanks to the Lumia 920's superb microphone, which picks up enough background noise to keep most automated services engaged, I'll be on the line until the SIM card is forcibly removed or the battery dies. And speaking of battery life... wow! If I get tired of yelling I can just put the phone down and let the automated service cycle through all its available prompts until its only remaining option is to connect me with an operator. I can go about my day while the phone does all the work of getting through for me. Talk about convenience!I know, you're probably thinking this sounds too good to be true. I originally thought the same thing, so I stopped by my local ATT; store to make sure I wasn't paying loads extra for a feature I had unknowingly signed up for. Not at all! In fact, I was kindly assured there was nothing that anyone could do to change it.If you're in the market for a truly smart phone, this one leads the pack by a healthy margin. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 20:25:06	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

65910845	Update 01 April 2011:I have to say that I just LOVE this phone!  The battery life, with stock battery, has been fine since I used the application to make 3G dominant: it certainly matches the battery life I had with my two Blackberry phones.  The phone is smooth and has worked flawlessly for me.  The editing text interface (using a little bar to find where your cursor actually sits) is a very handy and thoughtful upgrade for when you want to place the cursor in an exact spot.  Again, it's only been two weeks but I have no regrets.  After having had four types of Blackberry, the HTC Incredible (screen sucked in bright light), the Droid X (crummy interface), etc., this is THE FIRST phone I've had which--after two weeks--I can honestly say is THE BEST PHONE I'VE EVER HAD!Update 25 March 2011:Very happy with my Thunderbolt!  As other reviewer have noted some engineering type things (kick stand that in one position affects micro-usb jack) and a small power on/off switch stand out.  I just LOVE the HTC Sense UI much more compared to the crummy one on the Droid X.  The contacts manager function is much better and HTC's Footprints function is extremely handy as I drive to dozens of different fire stations.As another poster wrote to me, there is an easy free application that gives you access to the phone's functions and allows you to control if you're 3G of LTE.  The link to the application is:  [...]I downloaded it and it works quite well! Apparently doing the above will enable HTC Thunderbolt users to conserve battery life 4-fold and gain up to eight hours on a full charge with regular usage when not using a battery efficiency app.So there you have it, give it a go and feel free to let us know how you get on and whether you experience better battery life from your HTC Thunderbolt by posting to our comments area. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 20:40:06	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64756502	I was given the opportunity to review the Nokia Lumia 710, the first Nokia-powered Windows Phone 7.5 that will be available in the United States on January 11th on the T-Mobile network, and have been using it for the past week. While the phone is being pitched as an entry-level smartphone, the Nokia Lumia 710 has a more mid-range feel to it and is definitely a step-up from your average first-time smartphone. Don't let the $50 with a new 2-year contract price fool you - this is one great phone and the bargain price makes the deal even sweeter.Upon removing the Lumia 710 from it's packaging, what first struck me was how nice the phone felt in my hand. The size is nearly perfect - not too big, and not too small - and it feels nice and sturdy. True, it doesn't sport the classy aluminum casing that HTC has been wowing me with lately, but I gotta say that it seems much more capable of handling the accidental bumps and drops than Samsung designed mobile phones I've recently had my hands on (the plastic on those feels so cheap, and when I remove the back cover to replace a SIM card or something, I'm afraid I might break it if I pull too hard on the back cover). The Nokia Lumia 710 is solid, and it has already survived a couple accidental drops with nary a scratch or nick anywhere on its body.The 3.7-inch ClearBlack LCD screen is more than sufficient. True, I love a 4-inch or larger screen best, but just as was the case with the HTC Radar, another Windows Phone 7.5 I recently reviewed, using a smaller sized screen on this device than I'm typically used to really wasn't a huge adjustment at all.The also phone sports a 1.4Ghz Snapdragon processor with 512MB of RAM, and a pretty good 5-megapixel rear camera capable of 720p video capture. I've not experienced any lags in using the phone; the OS is snappy and reactive, and the photos I've taken have turned out relatively well.To date, my experience with Windows Phone 7.5 devices has been limited to HTC devices - the HTC HD7 and the HTC Radar. Both of those had similar navigation buttons and feels, but were different sizes. The HTC HD7 was the high-end beast of a phone, while the HTC Radar is the more modest, mid-range model. As the Nokia Lumia 710 is a Windows Phone by a different manufacturer, there are some subtle differences that I noticed. Some of the features of the Nokia phone I liked a lot, including the navigation buttons along the bottom of the screen that let you operate your phone. I found that the navigation buttons on the HTC Windows phones were ultra sensitive, and I often accidentally hit them as they sat in my pocket, or even held in my hand. The nav buttons on the Nokia require you to actually push on them to evoke an action. I like that. One thing I did not like, however, was the camera button. While you can snap a picture by touching the screen, the Lumia 710 also has a dedicated camera button. I've found that I have to press a little harder than I'd like, and that it is awkwardly located, making for a few situations in which I didn't get to capture the photo I desired.Another downside of the Lumia 710 is the lack of expandable SD storage, but this is an issue with all Windows Phones. Microsoft just simply doesn't allow you to swap out SD cards with their phones. You are stuck with the storage built-in, and in this case its 8GB of internal storage. If you're a music junkie, you know just how quickly you can fill up 8GBs.Another feature of the Nokia Lumia 710 that I have really enjoyed is Nokia Drive, the company's GPS navigation feature. It's superior to the Maps program HTC Windows phone features, and has turn-by-turn navigation (unlike the Maps program navigation). It's come in handy in the past few days as I do not have a separate GPS device and rely solely on my phone for navigation assistance.Nokia Lumia 710 4G Windows Phone, White (T-Mobile)Nokia Lumia 900 4G Windows Phone, Black (ATT;)HTC Radar 4G Windows Phone (T-Mobile)HTC HD7 Windows Cellphone UnlockedMicrosoft has a really great product in Windows Phone 7. As a former Apple-turned-Android-addict, I was initially hesitant to make the switch to a Microsoft product, but once I finally took the leap of faith and dove right in, I didn't regret it. Now you'd have to pry my Windows Phone 7.5 from my cold, dead hands.So who would I recommend this phone for? If you want a smartphone, but don't want to spend the big bucks to get a high-end model, this would be a perfect solution. You just can't get much better than $50 with a 2-year-agreement. If you're growing tired of the stale operating systems of Apple an Android, the amazing Metro Design of Windows Phone 7.5 will undoubtedly blow you away and make you wonder how you lived without it before.As a T-Mobile subscriber, I personally am holding out for a higher-spec Windows Phone 7.5, something along the lines of the Nokia Lumia 710 that ATT; launched this week because of the larger screen size and more storage space. If neither of those is an issue for you, then you may find the Lumia 710 to be a suitable mobile phone solution. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 20:44:29	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66462796	99% of cell phone users want a cell phone that works. N96 has a plethora of useless features and wizards that don't work but only frustrate the user. 90% of these addons do NOTHING for us. See below.For instance: after a week of reading all the manuals and online help, I've yet to get the GPS to work in ANY way. I am a techno nerd, a scientist and I embrace high-technology. So when I fail at a FEATURED function of this phone, I know that Nokia did not intend for it to actually work.I've had numerous Nokia phones and most-recently a Sony-Eriksson, and a Sangsung SGH-G608. All have had a nice PC suite that enabled copying of addresses from SIM to phone or mass media, synching with PC, etc. It was also easy to make such transfers without a PC.N96 does not allow simple management of CONTACTS; thus, it fails the most basic function of a phone, something my home portable phones on landline perform easily. It seems obvious that a user should be able to copy and backup contacts among Phone, SIM, mass storage, and PC. But apparently Nokia hasn't thought of that.The N96 does not seem to allow transfer of CONTACTS from SIM to phone, or to my PC. Thus, requiring manual entering of individual contacts. Most, if not all other phones accept contacts from a SIM.I bought one N96 from Amazon for myself to test before I would buy four more for friends overseas. In spite of the slick package, we really need a functional international phone. The Samsung GH608 is superior in all regards, though it doesn't have GPS (moot because the N96 GPS doesn't work). Thus, I'm thinking, eBay for the N96 and iPhone as a possible replacement.The PURPOSE of N96 is to get the user to game and surf online. Pure and simple. The PURPOSE of the N96 is NOT to easily place phone calls, manage contacts and calls. So... if you want to do anything like actually use a cellphone, do NOT get taken in by the N96 hype. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 20:51:11	Comparison	Unable to Use	Software	Replacement	Applications	Software		false

So ANY phone you get is likely imported, and therefore will only have a warranty in the phones country of origin. Hopefully this is the only downside, I spoke with 4 Nokia reps to try and get all my questions answered. Hardware and software wise... they seem to be and was told that they are identical.Just an FYI. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 20:51:11	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

70531525	This phone is a great buy. For starters you can see and fell the amount of design work done on it. When you hold it in your hand it feels like a quality product and the way it slopes on the sides helps for your hand to cradle it. Also the way all the manual buttons (volume, power/lock, camera) are on the side of the phone allows for you to intuitively use the phone one handed despite its larger size. I was skeptical of the wireless charging as first, seemed like a frivolous add on, but I have to admit it is nice to just pick the phone up off the charge pad. The camera has been pushed hard by Nokia and I have to admit it takes some great low light photos and you have to work to take a shaky photo with it. Also I feel like the image quality is clearer than your typical smartphone camera. The screen is also very impressive. It does as advertised work with gloves on and in direct sunlight increased the contrast on the screen so items pop out a bit more which is great when you trying to read an email on the go. In addition I don't feel the glare from the sun is all that noticeable.The introduction of the dual core processor is an improvement over the WP7 I had, it makes an already smooth OS even smoother and very responsive. The many Nokia apps are easy to use and stable as well as just fun to use. City lens is the best AR food app I have used so far. Overall it is a great phone and would recommend it to anyone. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 20:58:16	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

14078004	This is a great phone for your buck as compare to high end smartphone from apple, Samsung and blackberry, I will be buying a new smartphone and the release of this confuse me a little bit cause I decided to buy the Samsung galaxy s4, I did tried and tested this a week ago, the availability of Microsoft office suit, the GPS which I believe is pretty good comparable to my Magellan and garmin GPS. For GPS functionality alone you can save between 150 to 200 dollars by buying this phone, how about the availability of office suit wherein you can edit you document anyplace without going to your computer table or notebooks that is another 100 dollars savings, The camera feature is pretty good also. If this phone will cost you 450 dollars you deduct the saving from gps say 150 dollars plus say 50 dollars for the Microsoft office suit that is 200 dollars meaning you are only paying 250 dollars for LUMIA 920. I have magellan App's on my old iphone 3gs and it cost me $60.00, for nokia lumia the GPS is included for FREE, What is great about the NOKIA built in GPS is it is worldwide, my friend was able to use the nokia LUMIA GPS in ASIA. NOW I AM CONFUSE WILL DECIDE SOON WHETHER I WILL GET THIS ONE OR THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S4. I am a heavy user of Microsoft office suit and GPS for my daily routine. Since I have IPAD, IPHONE 3GS, I think I can have this phone so that I can access my word document anytime and in any places. I ever I decide to buy this phone I will use this together with my ipad and will maintain my old iphone for my other apps.

It's nothing fancy but it's good for talk/text, which is all I was looking for.Only complaints are it won't let you use too large of a file as a ringtone, and as many have mentioned before there is a (poorly thought out) safety feature of letting the user dial 911 even if the keypad is locked.  Even though I haven't managed to do that myself, thankfully, I have taken the phone out of my pocket to find 911 ready to go on the screen.  Oops!  Keeping it in a bag now!If you're looking for a cheap starter or temporary phone, this one isn't bad at all.

Colors look good just more like they are drawn with pastels.Final ThoughtsFor the money there is no better option, even money aside the only other phone that may be slightly better is the GS3. Tmobile has a prepaid $30 a month unlimited Data/Texting plan, and you can use a VOIP service with your data plan to get unlimited talk.If you can drop $350, there certainly is no reason to be on a contract with your carrier anymore.-Side note you will have to pay tax on the $350 even if you order online. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:07:05	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66102159	I ordered this phone on release date, and have been using it for 9 months now. This is the longest I've had a phone since the sidekick LX, so that does speak for itself. Before this I was using the Cliq XT, and within 45 days switched to this. Best decision I ever made.Now, as of today, this phone is still running only Android 2.1 (For my review, I will not speak of rooting/rooted phones). While I am not one of the people who MUST have the update the day it's available, I am disappointed at the fact that the Slide is still only at 2.1, because of the fact that the phone has so little internal memory (512MB). Why is this such an issue? Well because on 2.1 or prior, all the applications downloaded from the Marketplace save to the Internal memory. So even with an 8GB memory card (or 16 in my case), I can't download as many apps as I should be able to.The 600 MHz processor is quick, and I wish it was a bit faster so that it can properly run apps such as Angry birds with full grapics. However, this phone is a mid-tier smartphone, and at that a very good one. Wi-fi, 3G and Bluetooth all work seamlessly, and are very fast and easy to connect. The voice recognition is also very good (Dragon Dictation). I don't use the Genius button enough to give a good review on it, but the few times I've tried it, it's worked flawlessly.The 5MP camera is not as good as I had hoped. Comparing this 5MP camera with that of the Samsung Vibrant, Galaxy S 4G, Mytouch 4G, and G2, it's really bad. Granted, I am comparing it to T-Mobile's high tier smartphones, but be aware that this phone just doesn't take as good pictures as the other phones that boast a 5MP camera. (Yes, I am fully aware that the Megapixels don't dictate the quality of pictures).Battery is ok, not great. It usually gets me thru my work day, if I have a fully charged battery when I leave. If not, turning off the 3G, almost doubles my battery life (at the cost of internet speed of course).The Phone is loud and the speakers are great (the one downfall being that the speakers are on the back of the phone, making it hard to hear if I have it on a table for example). The Flash on the camera is bright, and the Keyboard on the phone is really comfortable, and took me maybe 3 or 4 days to get used to (coming from a Sidekick user of 4+ years). However, I've been using Swype, which works amazingly well, and when it's time for my next upgrade, I will probably going for an all-touch screen phone...as long as it has swype.The screen is decently sized at 3.4 inches, but just feels/looks small (especially when compared to the iPhone which only has a 3.5 inch screen). Youtube is crystal clear, and web browsing is great and looks good.All in all a good phone. Only problem is that there are now many new phones that are much better than this specs-wise, and at similar prices. However, for T-Mobile, this is still their #2 phone in terms of a full QWERTY keyboard phone (G2 being the #1, and the Cliq 2 at a distant #3). 	jwilets	10-25-2015 21:10:32	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
65265320	(Some background: I have had an EVO for more than a year now. I also have an iPad 2 and had spent enough time with an iPhone 4):: First things first ::This phone does not has as many apps as iPhone and it is not as flexible as an Android. However, it is fast, easy to use, simple and elegant which puts it in its own category. So, it is pretty similar to an iPhone in terms of user experience, but instead of every app for its own approach that Apple takes, Microsoft goes with every app is part of the system. And believe me, it works so well that you can't believe how Windows Phone 7 (WP7) is not getting the attention it actually deserves.:: Pros ::- Timely updates + Good looks + ReliabilityAll without the ugliness of Blackberry OS. My wife had a Blackberry before and new Blackberry phones are just not on par with others. So, she wanted to get an Android but it was quite impossible to find a good looking one that is smaller than 4 and even when you find some, they were almost always slow as hell thanks to the crapware (I'm looking at you Nascar!) and skins HTC/Motorola/Samsung loves to put on them. Where as this phone provides a fluid vanilla OS experience with a couple of HTC and T-Mobile specific apps that, by design, cannot get in your way.- The OS is directly supported by Microsoft, not manufacturer.This means, like iPhone, she doesn't have to wait for update to be released by HTC like I do with my EVO.- It already has most of the popular appsAnd they are considerably high quality. This is mostly due to the Microsoft's involvement with major apps and also because there are no fragmentation issues since WP7 imposes certain hardware specs and the OS is the same regardless of the manufacturer.- Solid construction and good looks.With its unibody design, device feels solid in hand and seems like it can take daily physical abuses (dropping, scratching, bending etc.) without a hitch.- Elegantly beautiful and smooth UIWhoever designed WP7 interface clearly put a lot of thought into it since it is both modern, simple and easy-to-use. It takes 5 minutes to get a hang of it and my wife hasn't looked at any manuals or anything to use it. The butter smooth animations, quality on-screen keyboard, responsiveness... you get the same feeling of smoothness throughout the whole device. Although, keep in mind that the interface is not as customizable as an Android.- 2-level dedicated camera button!I don't understand how this is not common practice but having a dedicated button is great. It also has the screen-tap option, if you like it the other way, but it's just disabled by default.- Bing integration works wellBuilt-in Bing services allow you to make live translations and product searches from camera snapshots, search local places around you, make voice activated searches, song recognition and possibly more. You want to see reviews of a book? Show it to Bing and it will tell you. You saw a Franch movie poster but don't know French? Take a picture of it and Bing will recognize the words and translate it for you. You can do the same things on other phones as well but it's just too easy and simple on this one. No extra apps needed either.- (Update 12/13) Battery performance is very good.This phone can make it through 2 full days with low to moderate usage with default settings, and my wife doesn't even bother to turning Wifi and GPS off. For a long time EVO user like me, this performance is a lot more than good. WP7 also provides some advanced battery saving options but we haven't tried that yet.:: Cons ::- App Market is still smallIf you can't live without hundreds of different apps with tons of alternatives for each of them, look somewhere else because Market is still in its infancy. There are not a lot of options for everything and apps that already exist are still getting used to concepts of the Metro UI. However, the apps that currently exist would satisfy users for most if not all use cases (twitter, facebook, games, whatsapp etc.)- Camera is good but not as good as an F2.2 should beEven though it's better than most and lens being F2.2 (like iPhone 4s or Galaxy Nexus) provides a good low light performance, the quality is not on par with latest Samsung or Apple devices, especially under low light.- (Update 12/13) Non-expandable memoryAlthough the 8gb built-in memory should be more than enough for most users, if you want to keep your whole music or movie archive with you, look somewhere else.:: Wrap up ::All in all, if you are looking for a solid, beautiful phone that provides a reliable and consistent experience with the most modern interface on the market, you can go with this phone and believe me, you will not regret it.(Update(12/13): Cleared some things up and added some extra information) 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:10:35	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
66267818	I bought this phone for my wife for Christmas. She has been pretty well satisfied with it other than a few quirks. If you watch a Youtube video on this phone the browser will close after the video is finished and you must start the browser again after every video you watch on Youtube. Also this phone will on occasion give an error message #34 when trying to send a text message but turning the phone off and back on seems to correct the problem. It doesn't happen a lot but it does happen. Other than this few minor details the phone works great just don't expect to play games all day or surf the web for extended amount of time because it kills the battery in a few hours. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:10:35	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false
65856602	The LG enV3 may not be a flashy phone, but I think it is most reliable phone with the most features possible without buying a smart phone and the required data plan.  The phone is solid, reliable and the camera is great.  My wife has used and loved hers for 3 years.  The only complaint was that the phone would shut-off.  This was easily solved by adding a spacer (3 sheets of paper) under the battery (look it up on youtube).  The keyboard is bigger than the slide-out phones. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:10:35	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	Other	Hardware	Internal Hardware	self-fixed	false

66801710	I got this phone when the Verizon Wireless website price was just $50!  I have no idea why they dropped it so low since it was already sold out all over the place, but since then it is now up to $200, and it is well worth it in my opinion.  I did a crazy amount of research into it before I decided to buy, notwithstanding the amazing price tag.  It still seems too good to be true, but it has even exceeded my expectations, mostly because I was prepared for the negativities that people pointed out in their reviews.  I'm a bit of a tech nerd, having built my own computer and repaired lots of electronics that most people wouldn't even consider repairing, so I kind of know my way around electronics better than most.  For me, it is perfect, but I can see how it may be difficult for those that aren't so accustomed to how the latest technology works.  Anyway, the screen looks amazing, it's insanely fast, and if you know how to manage your power options (turn off 4G, lower screen brightness, kill apps that aren't being used), which HTC makes it very easy with all of the widgets available, the battery life really isn't as bad as I thought it would be.  It easily will last the whole day with light use.  If you're heavily using it, you're probably sitting around somewhere that you can just plug it in anyway.  Plus an extended battery is only like 40 bucks, and it almost doubles the life, so if it's that big of a deal to you, just get the extended battery.  I really love the feel and look of the phone, and it fits perfectly in my hand and pocket.  The Beats Audio headphones sound amazing!  I was really blown away, so now I never use my iPod or iPad for music anymore, just my phone because the quality is so much better.The main complaints I saw were lousy buttons, the lcd is difficult to see in the sunlight, the size, and the battery life.  I've already talked about the size and battery-life, both have been fine for me.  With the LCD being difficult to see in the sun, you just have to adjust the brightness, which is really easy with the brightness widget, just a couple touches, and then everything is very clear and bright.  It has not been an issue for me at all.  As far as the buttons go, they're very slim to the phone, so they may take some getting used to at first when you're trying to wake up the phone or adjust the volume, but they work fine for me and I really don't think they take anything away from the phone at all.The only thing that's bugged me a very minimal amount on this phone is the phone ear speaker.  Every once in a while is sounds odd, almost like a blown speaker would, but I can still hear the other person just fine, it just has a weird digital type sound to it.  Difficult to explain but it's something I noticed.  I actually generally just use my Beats headphones when I call people since they have a built-in mic (which is awesome), so it's generally not even an issue.To wrap this up, I'd just like to compare the hardware of this phone with the Nexus, which is the big seller right now(my brother has one).  The Rezound is generally much less expensive, but beats out the Nexus hardware in a few areas, which really surprised me when I first noticed it.  It's worth pointing out though that the Nexus has Ice Cream Sandwich and the Rezound should be getting it soon, but it doesn't have it yet.  Darn you Verizon.Rezound:  Dual core 1.5 ghz processor, 1 GB RAM, 32 GB memory out of the box (16 internal, 16 memory stick that comes with it), 4.3 720p LCD display (not AMOLED sadly), 8 MP rear camera, 2 MP front cameraNexus:  Dual core 1.2 ghz processor, 1 GB RAM, 32 GB memory, 4.65 720p AMOLED display, 5 MP rear camera, 1.3 MP front cameraSo you can see that the Rezound actually has a better processor and better cameras, as well as coming with Beats Audio headphones.  I'm not saying it's better than the Nexus since the Nexus has a better display, ICS, better battery life, and slimmer, lighter design, but I am saying you get quite the bang for your buck for the Rezound, especially when it was only $50.  Love this phone!  I'm so glad I got mine when I did.I wanted to add also that I've used an iPod Touch and an iPad for a long time now, so I have decent experience with the Apple app market compared to the Android app market and I must say that I strongly prefer the Android market, since I don't like to pay for my apps.  If you don't mind paying for most of your apps, go with Apple, but since I like free things much more, I really prefer the Android app market. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 21:15:26	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

37494513	I have had this phone for about a month.  I chose the DNA because I have less than perfect vision and needed the larger screen.

So far I have not encountered any issues with the sim card.  I have actually had no problems of any kind.My last phone was the Stratosphere, which I grew to hate.  With light usage I was lucky to make through a whole day.  The DNA gets me through 2 1/2 days of light usage on 1 charge!  Heavy usage gets me through 1 day.  I was recently at a dog show that was held in a rural area with poor connections.  Numerous other people had a hard time getting a connection but the DNA NEVER had any problems!

74018002	i am a gadget freak; around the house i have various iphones, an ipad, older nokias (maemo), one android samsung and a wp7 samsung focus. the nokia 920 makes all these other devices look drab and ugly. there's something about the combination of the bright WP8 colors and the solid build quality that elevates this phone to a work of art.the operating system is a lot of fun; i've spent most of the last two days poking around in its corners, finding new things it's capable of. i am sure i'll eventually get bored with it, but for now i'm finding enough new features to play with (e.g., xbox smartglass, tighter facebook integration, customizable start screen notifications, nokia mapping software that provides turn-by-turn instructions in multiple languages, kids mode, wireless charging, nfc support). the phone is very responsive (dual-core helps!) and so far battery life seems good if not spectacular. The camera is just fantastic, as reviewers have pointed out.but again, the big surprise for me is not the functionality but the aesthetics of the phone. it's just so darn pretty!one caveat: this is a big phone! it'll fit in your pocket, but it definitely takes some getting used to.

83027635	Hardware: 5/5You will not find a better phone on the market as of right now, period. First of its class 1080p LCD3 screen is so crisp and clear you wouldn't believe it until you see it. Coming from the Galaxy Nexus (720p) I really didn't think it could possibly get much better, but comparing the two is like night and day! Very impressed! Match that up with the latest quad-core processor and 2gb of RAM and you really have one of the fastest phones any carier has to offer.Software: 5/5Runs Android 4.1.1 (Jellybean) right out of the box! Which is amazing because if you know anything about HTC and how they update their phones, then you will be glad you have Jellybean because odds are you will not be seeing any other Android OS upgrades for quite some time... if ever... Some people really don't like HTC's Sense skin but I personally think it adds a very nice looking touch to android. I had the Galaxy Nexus and vanilla android always kind of left me with something more to desire.Features: 5/5Here is where just about everyone will differ on this phone, no SD expansion and only a 2020mAh battery. If you're anything like me, then you will never play games on your phone and you don't have much interest in using your phone as a media consumption device (i.e. Movies, Games, Music) For that, I have an iPod and a laptop. With 16gb of storage (about 11gb partitioned) you have plenty of space to hold all of your pictures. As for the battery, well I guess it really all depends on what you're coming from in your last phone. For me it was the Galaxy Nexus and let me say this phones battery blows me away with how long it lasts. Full day of fairly heavy usage (streaming Pandora to and from class, Facebook, Gmail, texting) and by the end of the night I'm still hanging around 25-30%. With my Nexus I was reaching for the charger around lunchtime... of course if your last phone was the RZR Maxx then yes, you may be disappointed, but for most I think you'll be pleased.Camera: 5/5Blows me away, it's really incredible! Again it all depends on what you're converting from, if it was a previous iPhone 4/4S/5 then you might think its on par or even slightly less, but I am very impressed at the clarity. Still wouldn't depend on it to document an epic hiking adventure, it is after all still a cell phone camera. For quick shots though it is excellent.Overall: 5/5My perfect phone and worth the upgrade! In fact I didn't want to loose my unlimited data so I ended up paying full retail for the phone (599) and it was still worth it! But this phone, you will not regret it. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:22:34	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65470796	I ordered this phone 2 weeks ago and received it in only 5 days, contrary to the 2-3 week shipping estimate. The phone has a very solid feel to it, and there is nothing flimsy about it. The screen is HUGE; it dwarfs my iPod touch. It came with a usb charger, a cord, 2 batteries, a pre installed screen protector, a plastic back cover type case, and a cheap set of headphones with an inline mic. The battery life isn't bad if you make sure to manage the wifi, GPS, brightness, and bluetooth settings. Obviously if you leave them on all the time, battery life will be almost non-existent. This phone does support tethering, and it works well for me. I was able to use the phone's internet on my laptop with no problem. The maps are good, but the phone sometimes has trouble in buildings locating the GPS signal. The rear facing camera takes good to very good pictures, but sometimes has trouble focusing correctly. The front facing camera isn't great, but it's only used for skype anyway, so no complaints. The proximity sensor that shuts off the screen when you have the phone to your ear works fine for me; I had read somewhere that it would hang up when you touched the phone's end button against your cheek, but that hasn't been a problem. Also, this phone does have an accelerometer, aka gravity sensor, so games like bike race work well on this phone. This phone is really fast, too. I can stream music while playing games without a problem. The flash is about as bright as the flash on other smart phones and the touch screen is really sensitive. Ice Cream Sandwitch is nice, it works perfectly on this phone. The phone does act a little funny when it's charging on the included charger, but it works fine with other micro usb chargers, so no worries there. The main speaker is pretty loud for a phone, but the speaker used for phone calls could be louder. I activated this phone with Straigh Talk and had my old tracfone number ported to this phone in less than 2 hours. The stock keyboard leaves something to be desired, so I recommend that you just download Swiftkey 3, which costs about $4 after a free one month trial. In all, this phone is really great, especially when you consider that an unlocked Samsung Note costs around $500.UPDATEThis phone is still going strong after about 3 months. Sadly, after having it for only a couple weeks, I dropped the phone on its face and the camera stopped working. Since I'm not much of a picture taker and I didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning it, I figured I could live with it and kept going. A couple days ago I fell off of my longboard with the phone in my pocket and the screen cracked, as would any phone when the weight of a human sand witched it against concreted. This phone is so good I'm just gonna buy another one to replace my current one. Seriously, if I wasn't so rough on it it would still be functioning just as good as when I got it; it's not any slower than when I got it. Highly recommend. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:22:34	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
65073168	There's an old nursery rhyme that goes:#34;There was a little girl, who had a little curl, right in the middle of her forehead.And when she was good, she was very, very good,but when she was bad, she was horrid.#34;This device is like that little girl.  I bought it because of the design and the waterproof case.  These are perfect.But what they don't tell you in the reviews is that Sony's software is terrible, and the radios in the phone are no good.  I had to switch carriers, and their coverage is worse than they'll tell you, and this device can't even use the coverage that is there.  It's the worst of three phones that I've used in my house.  It'll show three bars of signal, but then when you try to make a call, it will say #34;no coverage#34; and fail to connect.  It has #34;wifi calling#34;, but that doesn't work half the time, either.  Again, it will say it's connected, but fail when you actually try to use it.Sony's software is pretty much unchanged from 5 year's ago.  It wasn't up to iTunes standard then, and now is just pitiful.  And there are five different music and video players to choose from, each unable to play the other ones' media.If you want a cool toy to impress your friends, this is definitely one.  If you want a robust, useful tool that is also brilliantly designed, this one fails.  Unfortunately review sites are full of people who care only about coolness and not about utility. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 21:24:50	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

64811232	This is well-designed phone:  rubberized surface, induction charging, slide out keyboard and great Palm OS/HP WebOS.  Unfortunately, after the disaster of Carly Fiorina's leadership, HP made the mistake of hiring a CEO from SAP, a German business software company.  In the one year that gentleman was there, HP took it's $1bn+ into Palm, launced HP WebOS and two months' later, abandoned the platform and products!  Now one and half years later, it is only NOW that tablet intefaces are approaching the useability and performance of WebOS. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 21:24:50	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
17836001	I had an iPhone 4 for the past couple of years and decided Android had made enough advancements that I should give them consideration... and boy did it ever impress!I went into the Verizon store trying to decide among the iPhone 5, HTC Droid DNA, Samsung Galaxy S3, Samsung Galaxy Note 2, and the Motorola Droid Maxx HD.  Without a doubt... the HTC DNA was the most impressive.I've heard knocks on the battery life.  And while there are better batteries out there, this one is actually quite good and gets me through my work day.  They have optimized the phone for this battery.  I'll say this... it gets better battery life than my wife's Samsung Galaxy S3.The other knock people have mentioned is on the limited storage.  I'm used to limited storage (as with the iPhone 4).  I never used up my 16 GB's on my iPhone... and I don't see this being an issue for me on the DNA.  However, if you plan on storing your movie collection on your phone (not sure why someone would)... then this phone isn't for you.The screen is truly a sight to behold.  Best out there.  The phone is snappy and buttery smooth.  HTC Sense+ has been an enjoyable experience. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 21:24:50	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
64845596	Wow!  This is a BEAUTIFUL phone, kicks butt of flip version of Shine from Verizon.  Slider is sweet, phone feels solid.  AND boy DOES it SHINE!!.... in virtually most lighting.  Roll bar select key is a bit tricky at first but soon becomes very natural, AND you look so cool because of it!  Has basic goodies, SIM card very accessible and compatible, battery life better than average.  Standard MP3 player.  Has microSD expansion slot for up to 2GB.  Slight problems with reception outside of major metropolitan areas and some dead spots in small cities due to tri-band but overall pretty good (I use ATT/Cingular).  Tons of cool ringtones and sound effects.  Mirrored effect slightly difficult to read in strong sunlight.  USB connection to desktop worked effortlessly like direct plug flash drive.  Camera quite decent although some delay in trigger.  Has flash but only on/off - no auto.  2 megapixel photos are better than most.  Hottest slider around, no doubt.  I use this as my cool factor phone.  Highly recommend it!  Please check out tri-band reception in your area first to avoid disappointment. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 21:24:50	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66119919	READ THIS REVIEW!! BUYER BEWARE!!My own phone broke completely on me a month before my free upgrade date so I decided to just buy something cheap to last me until then. And yeah, for a #34;smartphone#34; it's cheap, but I don't even think it was worth the $51 I paid for it. More like $25-30, If that.For one, fresh out the box, I tried to remove the back cover so I could put in the battery, of course, this is something the makers must have realized that the customer must do right? I mean, they sent the phone and the battery seperately, it's not like an Apple iOS device where the cover isn't removeable. Well the cover is so tight on there and it's so flimsy, the freaking cover cracked when I tried to remove it. Yes, 5 seconds out the box, and it was already breaking.Secondly, after I got past that ridiculousness, I figured #34;Alright, rough start, but it's still a pretty sleek looking device, can't be that bad. I put in the SIM card from my old phone and turn it on. First off, the startup for the phone looks and sounds like it's from a 2002 Nokia phone, which dropped my expectations even further, all the buttons look like they were made with Microsoft Paint, and the screen isn't a touchscreen, more like a punchscreen, because you damn near have to punch it to make it work, plus it feels like the screen is made of clear duct tape. And of course, IT DOESNT READ THE SIM. So, fearing breaking the phone again, I turn it off, remove the cover, and go #34;Oh well maybe if I put it in the second slot. Nope, still doesn't work. So I'm not sure how this is supposed to be useful, especially if most of the useful parts of the phone need the SIM to run.Thirdly, I decided to just suck it up and start exploring, I noticed the date said 1-15-2013, So they're only about a year and 6 months off. I go to fix it, and when I try to type in my local area, I realize...This damn thing's keyboard has the old-school setting. Yes, If I want to type #34;atlanta#34; I have to sit there and type 2-8-555-2-66-8-2. I haven't typed out words like that on a phone since I was a child, and I'd rather not go back to doing that.Overall, I wish I had made a different decision. If I wasn't laughing at how preposterously horrible this phone was I'd be probably be crying at the same. I had never heard of SVP before and I'm starting to figure out why, this is like some chinese piece of crap I wouldn't even pass off to a toddler to play with. I not only would not recommend this phone, I would specifically ask that people DONT buy this phone. SVP needs to focus their efforts somewhere else, cause phone making in the 21st century just aint their deal. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:28:12	Complaint	Unable to Use	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Enclosure		false

22616196	This is a simple phone in that you can put phone numbers in and call people which is my major use for it.  It does a lot ofdifferent applications that as yet I am not fully knowledgeable about but also things that I don't need it for.  I was interested in a simple phone and that is why I ordered this one.  It is small (cute), easy to use for what my needs are and has a camera and a flashlight neither of which I have used yet.  It will play FM stations on it for a total of 4 hours though I have not used it for that long.  One of the best things about it is the length of time the battery lasts.  So far it has lasted for 2 weeks without recharging and I have talked on it for at least  2 and 1/2 or more hours and the battery does not show any use. It uses SIM cards to collect your stored information and has slots for 2 of them.  I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it IF you don't want to use the internet or other applications like that. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 21:29:50	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

I gave it every chance because I got it brand spanking new from Cingular for $65 as a replacement.  The volume (of the person on the other end) could not be made loud enough, and the display is comparatively grainy and small.  The instruction manual is lacking.  I really disliked this phone.

79678229	I have been using Lumia 920 for a month now. This is the best phone ever. I was an iPhone user and did not find any inconvenience of switching. Many people complain about number of Apps. But I do not find that is the problem for me. I frequently use Nokia Map, Nokia Drive (still in beta), some games (Black Jack). They are all good Apps. So far, no rebooting. WP8 is very fast and I got job done.Camera is superb and better than my Cannon. We just came back from a Cruise trip from Bahamas and use my phone shot many videos.There is a learning curve though. But regular users should pick up within two weeks. Trust me, if I can learn how to use it, everybody can.Price is a steal. You will never get this price for the next version because both hardware and software are maturing. The only reason you can get this low price is because not many people know WP8.Give it a try and you will feel it worth your money! 	jwilets	10-25-2015 21:37:31	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65412843	This is the best phone I've had lately. I had a Galaxy S3 before this one and so far I'm loving this little guy. One of the things I like the most is Battery life, way better than my S3. Without heavy use, cause I'm not allowed to use it at work, I've reached 2 1/2 days in one charge. Almost pure Android, I think, is the reason for this exceptional battery life. Samsung gives you a lot of options on their phones but you don't really need ALL of them, at least in my case, and all this features just consume a lot of power.I think this is the best phone you can get for $189.00 Unlocked. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:37:51	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65664834	About a week after I bought the Sanyo innuendo, a bubble started to form in between the screen. Doing some in depth research I came to found out his was a common problem with this phone. I also had issues with the phone crashing. It is a very limited phone that is supposed to be for texting but be don't text to fast, or the phone will freeze on you and you'll have to take the battery out.I sent in the phone to the company and I received it back a week ago and it has crashed to the point of no return.This phone didn't even last me 4 months. It is very common for these phone to have major software glitches and manufacturer defects. I would not trust it. I had a Sanyo Mirro too and it didn't last more than 8 month, very fragile, dropped it once, 3 foot drop onto carpet and it cracked the part that held the button that turned it to the front screen, so I would randomly have my phone glitch out in my pocket.I will never purchase another Sanyo phone. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:39:52	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Enclosure		false
64650740	I had an LG Xenon before this and ATT didn't have this model anymore. Not surprisingly as mine was over 2 yrs old before the battery started to falter (even after replacement of battery). I bought a go phone Zenon, knowing it was a bit more basic than what I had but I was disappointed. It takes me 5x longer to get to my short cuts compared to the XENON and the QUERTY board is difficult to use. I have issues punching the keys and getting the right spelling of words. I guess I don't punch them hard enough...really??!!! They look really smooth, but they're difficult to use.It's ok for a teenager, beginner with the basic features with a bit of sleek added to it, but why does it have to be that difficult to just get your text messages and delete them from your phone? The camera is ok if you just want to take simple pics (like the price of an article at a store), but forget taking pics of people in dark places (no flash), and the resolution is average to poor. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:39:52	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

I have had it for a year and a half, and I've never liked it at all. Now it's falling apart, when you touch the screen in one place, it activates something else on a different part of the screen. The screen gets scratched up really easily. The interface is terrible. This is definitely the worst phone I have ever had in my life. I would seriously trade this for the phone I had ten years ago. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 21:40:04	Complaint	Other	Both	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Display	all around	false

66787150	The phone came in an excellent condition (brand new)one day before it was supposed to arrive.  The suggestions by PromoCell on unlocking the phone and installing Opera browser were not necessary as the phone came unlocked, and the browser was already installed. Instant messaging started working as soon as I inserted my SIM card, but in order to get an automatic voicemail box, I had to call ATT and they gave me a direct number, which I logged in. I agree with a prior reviewer who mentioned that the phone has a slow processor. I would also add that the WI-FI does not seem to work nicely, but the reason may also be the same: processor. Other than that, it is a pretty good phone for the price (I paid 129 dollars and 5 dollars for shipping and handling).

Not great reception at my house, but that would not be an issue with the phone, just the service.  Now the phone has lived with me for 6 months it has a mind of it's own. Random applications will start up, like angry birds for no reason, no one has touched it. It shuts off again, randomly.  The list of random start ups: calls a random contact, shuts down, ends calls, starts games, opens the weather app... I could go on, but the phone thinks it knows when I want to do things, but really it doesn't. It really is taking the smart phone title a little to far.  The map function has started parroting itself.  A lot of crazy things have been happening with this phone... Oh also the phone stores all apps on the phone's tiny memory, so if you add 5 good luck.  I am not a crazy app adding lady, I think I have added ten, and the phone keeps telling me it's low on memory.... I am so over the Galaxy CRAZY rush....

84000023	UPDATE:  I traded this for a Nexus 5, but I still loved this phone like no other Android since... Original review below.----------I'm a regular iPhone user, but I always own the latest greatest vanilla Android so I can keep my knowledge fair and equal. I've owned every Google vanilla phone since Google started with the Nexus One. This hardware with the latest OS is the first time I've felt really comfortable and ready to switch. The apps I use are also finally usable enough and in the right place that I could do it with little heartburn.Because this phone and the previous phone, Galaxy Nexus both support the latest edition of Android OS, my main objective is to tell you what I like about this phone better. It's simple-- the edge of the phone has a really nice bevel to grip it. The Galaxy Nexus has a pretty smooth edge which requires you to #34;cup it#34; in your hand and sometimes use two hands is easiest. This phone has a nice bevel to keep it gripped in the hand so there is no issue holding it.From a performance perspective I should notice a marked increase from the Galaxy Nexus but I'll be honest-- this is not something I noticed. It may be that I simply didn't use in extreme ways to prove this difference.That all being said, in my opinion this is superior hardware experience to the Galaxy Nexus, but I wouldn't hesitate to go with the Galaxy Nexus if cost is an issue/focus. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 21:48:54	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
85030315	Excellent performance, beautiful screen.  Until you drop it.  I dropped it ONCE from 2 feet after about 2 months.  Shattered screen.  The feature of having the glass go all the way to the edge means that if you drop it and it lands on any portion of the edge, it will shatter.  It's $220 to fix, and two calls to HTC landed two separate representatives encouraging me to go elsewhere to get it fixed to save money and time!  Their time to turn around the phone is TEN DAYS!  There must be a huge demand, which means there must be a lot of people shelling out $220 to fix them.  The other problem with the design is since it's such a large phone I can't imagine putting a protective case around it and being able to fit it in my pocket (front or shirt - and my pants/shirts are larger than most as I'm 6' 2).

66223803	First off, I love my new HTC Desire HD.  It is by far my favorite phone and, man, what a huge upgrade it is from Nokia C6!I'm not going to comment on all the tech specs as this phone is already half-outdated (released at the end of 2010 I believe) in today's tech standards.  The touch screen is extremely responsive yet not overly sensitive.  User interphase takes a moment to adjust to for a Nokia user, but it's fairly easy  friendly once you lay your hands on it.  Picture quality is superb, though I am yet to try out how it works with the flash light (many phone cameras are doomed with taking poor quality pictures when using flash light).  Processor speed is very good - most apps can be downloaded  fully installed within 30 secs (of course, also depends on your connection speed).With all my praises for this phone, I do find a few things that bug me:- battery life: so short.  This is my first HTC but I heard it's a common HTC problem.  But, 75% left after 3 hours of AIRPLANE mode w/ hardly any usage or 85% left after two hour with 3G on but no activities?  This phone would never last an 8-hour day with moderate usage.- sloppy design of the battery lid: feels cheap and very hard to take off  put back.  Every time I do so I feel like I am going to break that little poor piece of plastic.  This bugs me a lot.- poorly designed lid for the SIM card  micro SD card slot: the phone looks perfectly smooth out of the box.  BUT, once you insert a SIM card and put the lid/cover back, the SIM card creates a bump, and the phone is no longer perfectly flat.  Doesn't bother me that much, but HTC should be ashamed of this silly design.  Are they expecting people to use this phone solely as a portable wifi device without a SIM card???- Position  design of the camera: without a phone cover, the way the camera sticks out is doomed for scratches.- Doesn't come with a factory screen protector sheet: ALL cellphones I've purchased brand new, whether the traditional ones (i.e. non-smart) or smart ones, even flip phones, came with a screen protector sheet that can be easily peeled off.  I tend to keep those on for as long as I possibly can as I find them effective enough for protecting my screen.  This phone is the first that came w/o one.  I'm quite disappointed because they fail to provide such little things that cost them literally NOTHING all for the greed of making extras (or in favor of merchants lower in the food chain) from the side products.Overall, pleasant to use but falls short on many little things.  For all its pluses, I still gave it a four star, but it really is closer to a 3.5. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 21:52:31	Neutral	Other	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Ports	casing	false

Good features, easy to use and just overall good.Although i would like to have a removeable battery and an extra slot for memory cause it only gives you like 11gb. other than that it's awesome.This is a warning. Only use the HTC charger it came with. Do not use a different charger. I was charging the DNA with my friends charger because i was at his house and he has the razr MAXX andI didn't force it in it went in smoothly and in about 10min my phone became super hot and shut off. It wouldnt turn back on so iwent to my house and tried charging it on my htc charger that came with it. Nothing. I took it to the nearest verizon store and he told me i fried it. I had no idea that using a different charger could do that to a phone. Verizon is going to replace it so that's good but they were all out in all of the stores around me haha so there gonna send it in the mail.Awesome phone, just dont charge with a differen't charger. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:52:31	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

37283110	Nothing to complain about the phone.  I love it especially the big screen!  It looks great and feels great.  Screen resolution is unbelievable.  Overall, I am liking the phone, but there are few things that prevented me from giving it a 5 stars.1.The absence of headphones from the package.  I don't get it.  Seems to be very intuitive, but somehow Nokia decided not to include one.2.Very easy to bring up bing search by accident.  It's just the way how the buttons are laid out and the touch sensitivity of the phone.  Even after I turned down the sensitivity to normal, it's still very easy to switch to bing search unintended.3.No mute switch on the phone.  You will have to turn the vibrate on from setting first, then press volume control, then you will be able to switch between vibrate and ring + vibrate.  If you want it to be just silent and no vibrate, then you will have to go back to setting and set vibrate to off.  Seems to be more work than needed.4.The screen does scratch easily.  I was being very careful, but I still saw fine scratch through light reflection after first day of use from fingers?5.This one derived from 4.  I tried to look for accessories (screen protector  case) for the phone at bestbuy, and I couldn't find any.  Amazon has some stuff, but very limited, too.  The only place sells Lumia 920 accessories  in store is ATT;, and you  know what that means, you going to pay premium over it.  The speck candy shell case is priced at 38, and screen protector is 25.  I needed the screen protector so I shelled out 25 + tax, and decided to go naked on the phone.6.Lack of apps.  Some apps is very important to some people.  My wife also got the phone, but when she found out that whatsapp is not available on windows 8 phone yet, she is not so happy.  I think microsoft needs to do something about it if they are serious about windows phone.The phone itself is great, but the lack of accessories and apps might hold people back from switching.  However, I have no regret.  I am very happy with the big screen this phone has to offer.  I can wait on everything else. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:52:31	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

Network connectivity speed is awesome too. It can be operated quite well even under weak signal environment. As a frequent traveller it comes very handy for me.

43315048	I bought two of these Blu Tank T190i phones from Amazon. Only one time was I able to charge either phone up to operational level, and then the phones were only operational one time for about three weeks each. Many times after that, I tried to charge them either using the Blu USB charger or my computer USB port. The phones showed as charged, and then when I unplugged them, they would not respond to keypad presses and turn on. When I plugged them back into their chargers, they showed as charging again even though the display showed they were fully charged prior to unplugging.Most likely, this was a battery problem, but I had no way of knowing that for certain. I emailed Blu's customer support, and all they would say is that if it's beyond Amazon's return period, they can't do anything about it. They offered NO troubleshooting or repair suggestions, even in response to specific questions. I even asked them if they have had any similar Blu Tank problem reports, and they did not respond. I did not wish to buy $9 replacement batteries without knowing whether this fix will work, so I tossed these phones in the trash and bought better quality phones, theSamsung GT-E1182Lbar phones.I recommend that you look at phones other than these Blu Tanks. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:58:29	Complaint	Unable to Use	Hardware	Replacement	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

65217698	This product is all it is advertised.  I received it from Amazon prior to the expected arrival date in new condition.  It was in an unlocked condition so I can use it on any GSM network.  This is my first Android smartphone and so far it does everything I desire from a cellphone.  The screen resolution is good and the screen size, while only 3.65 inches is adequate for doing Emails and online websites. The phone size is perfect, not too big and not too small.  The 1Ghz processor speed is very fast also compared to the Nokia C6 I had before.  Samsung did an automatic update of the software (2.3 Gingerbread) the first time I went to their website.Calls are clear and texting is ok, though somewhat slow due to the small size of the screen and my large hands. I got spoiled using the slideout keyboard on the Nokia (unfortunately it broke after 18 months).  The 5mp camera takes great pictures.  A great phone and I highly recommend it for the price ($240) and quality. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:58:29	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
33511580	The phone is great.  It's fast and responsive, it takes excellent photos, the speakers are great, and the phone itself is the perfect size. Here's the big but - the screen shatters easily.  I've had a lot of smartphones and I haven't experienced as much as a single screen crack with any of them.  However, after having this phone for one month, the screen shattered (and I mean completely shattered) after a fall from a twelve-inch height where the device landed flat on its back (not on its side).  It still works just fine in every possible way, I just can't really see what I'm doing anymore.  I'm pretty disappointed in the lack of resilience the screen exhibited.  Upon a quick search I discovered that this is a known problem with the phone.  Apparently, the screen even has a tendency to shatter on its own under certain conditions. I'm pretty bummed.  I wish I had known before I bought the phone.  If I had, I would have definitely sprung for the insurance and I recommend that you do if you buy this phone. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 21:58:29	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Display		false
73067003	If you depend on your phone to work with bluetooth, be aware of the potential for serious dysfunction, and be prepared to return it before your return window closes.Upgrading from my old Nexus One to the Nexus 4, and trying to get it to work with my car's hands-free system has been an unmitigated nightmare. Dangerous, too. I'm very disappointed. I previously believed the Nexus line to be extraordinarily well-supported by Google. I'm sorry to report from personal experience that there are serious cracks in that expectation.Just for the record, I've had NO problems using any other phone with my car to this point.I went online to research the issue and make sure I wasn't missing something. Forget it, this phone has serious bluetooth issues.  I found reasonable people discussing the problem online, even on Google's own Code.Google.com site (for example see Issues 41625, 42520, 42255, 39688). Google takes no public responsibility for this problem, which might explain why no reviews I am aware of mention the problem. So many decent, unsuspecting people wasting their time with this problem, and Google is completely AWOL...  I would expect better from Google when it comes to their flagship device.Tech support is clueless, shirking responsibility, suggesting the problem is with me or my car.Personally, I am disgusted with Google for putting out a product that is obviously, dangerously broken. 	jakeg6	10-25-2015 22:12:46	Complaint		Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Display		false
66618711	I bought this refurbished phone for 25.00. Description was accurate as it did have some scratches and did show wear and tear. My goal was to turn off Iphone which I was paying 30.00 for internet and try to knock down my bill from Verizon. I got the phone on the day they said I would get it, charged the battery for an hour(reached full charge in 40 min) drove to Verizon and they activated  it in 60 seconds. Phone works fine and I've had no problems. Texting works fine. I am now saving 30.00 a month. In fact I have had the phone over a week an have yet to charge it.  I was really nervous about buying this phone.

Other disadvantages of Lumia is the app store.

85617868	I love Windows 8, I like this phone, I owned it for less than 24 Hrs when it slipped between my bed and its foot board, as I went to retrieve it, it fell less than 1 foot to the floor and cracked the glass from one side to the other.Not a scratch visible on the phone or a cracked place on the glass. I contacted Nokia customer service and they refused to do anything about it except to tell me to call their service center, since this phone has Gorilla glass, a gentleman commented on my review and advised me of the same, I am now convinced that this phone was defective from the factory,  repair will be 143.00. this is un- acceptable , My previous phone was a Galaxy and I dropped it at least a dozen times over the 3 years I owned it, no broken glass ever. I understand glass breaks, Think twice before you buy this phone unless you never drop your phone (LOL). Oh by the way you cannot just replace the glass itself it requires the entire  Display unit as it is all one unit so expect to pay big bucks to replace broken glass, Verizon offered this phone for 50 bucks /2year contract, now I understand why. I have to say otherwise it is a great phone but companies must back their products or lose their customers. I have insurance on the phone they will replace for 99.00 which I appreciate but this is really a Nokia Problem and I will never buy another Nokia product because of this. 	jakeg6	10-25-2015 22:12:46	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

28720899	I broke my phone about 2 weeks ago and I decided screw the contract and bought a phone free and clean. So I decided Nexus 4. It was the best decision I have made so far. 300 8GB unlocked phone for $299 + S/H + Tax still come to $336 direct from Google Play Store. It has Quad Core processor with 2GB running RAM. I use my dropbox and Spotify. So not much of sync my Music/Videos much on my side. So 8GB is more than enough for me. This phone ran great. No ATT; or T-mobile Bloatware. Those things will slow down your phone so much and I hated them.The only thing you need to watch out for is ATT; 4G LTE is not compatible with Nexus 4G radio frequency. It will only work for T-Mobile in Certain area in San Jose. You will able to find more article online about this. The only thing I can get out of ATT is HSPA really sad. For regular user, it is not a big deal. But I was really wanted to use my phone to be mobile hotspot. And ONE great thing about Nexus 4 is you are automatically get the Mobile HotSpot without subscribe to their extra data package. But watch out for hitting your limit.Overall, it is a great phone and it is really 1 of the best phone out there at this time.Updated: (7/14/13)I rode a mountain bike trail with my phone. I was doing downhill and my phone dropped out of my packet. I was down 10 meters before I could stop and looked for my phone. I thought I broke another phone. But this phone won't quit. The screen is really tough, not even a scratch after the fall. Even it was face down when  I found it on top of bunch of rocks. it only have 2 cosmetic dents on the plastic rim side. Otherwise the phone is working as usual. Really 1 tough phone! 	jwilets	10-25-2015 22:24:36	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
26946315	I love how people complain about how thick and heavy this phone is compared to iphone or galaxy series. Then again, owners of iphone and galaxy series have to purchase thick and heavy phone cases in order to protect their phone from breaking if they were to drop the phone. Nokia users don't have to worry about this problem. Effectively, this phone is thinner and lighter than most phones out there because it doesn't need a heavy case. Nokia knows how to build a strong and useful phone.This is the best phone I ever held in my life and I was planning to pick between iphone 5, galaxy s3 and this phone. Eventually I ended up picking this one and I don't regret it at all. This phone is everything iphone 5 wishes it could have been. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 22:27:19	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

The screen is bright, the processor is very fast, and number of free apps is unbelievable. But my excitement was cut short after the first day of usage. I fully charged the phone, went to work and showed all my co-workers my new beautiful phone and how good it was. However, by the end of the day, the battery was dead. All I did with the phone was made a few calls and that was it and played very few games. I thought maybe I had down loaded too many apps, so I deleted about 25% of them, I deemed the screen, turn off wifi when not in use, put the phone to sleep in 2 minutes when not in use. I down loaded battery monitor and checked and deleted what was consuming too much battery. It got just a little better but the battery still drains like crazy.

57161632	I have been using this mobile phone for 2 weeks and have been very happy it. I was using the Nokia Lumia 710 and find the 810 far superior. The screen is very clear and large; the color is quite vivid. The 810 runs faster and smoother than 710 and Dell Venue Pro, which I had prior to the 710. The camera takes great pictures. I take many photos of my dog and usually get the red eyes effect with indoor pictures. It has not happened with 810's camera. It has a forward facing camera for video chat with Skype. The placement of the speakers at the bottom of the phone is a better than on the back, as on the 710. I like the power button on the right side rather than on top of the phone. The touch screen is very responsive. The phone get very good reception and the sound quality of calls is great. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connects very quickly. The micro SD slot is a very welcome addition. The phone has some weight but I would not consider it heavy. It has a very solid feel to it. Battery last over a day for me.I keep reading about how Windows Phone is lacking in apps, compared to iPhone and Android. I don't find this to be a problem. There are many good apps, that can replace most missing ones. One example is Slacker Radio, which is great alternative to Pandora. But Microsoft said Pandora is coming to Windows Phone. Nokia's exclusive apps are great; Drive is an excellent GPS app. Nokia Transit, Music and City Lens are awesome. One app I am sad that is not available on WP8 is Adobe. It is available for WP7 but not support here. At least Microsoft released a PDF Reader app, in Abode's place. The Facebook and Twitter integration works smoothly. I am able to check my email from Gmail and Yahoo, along with Hotmail. IE and Bing works well.A drawback to Lumia 810, is the availability of accessories, such as Cyan charging back. The T-Mobile site showed it being out. Now I don't see it. Wireless charging pad is not currently available either. Hopefully that will change soon. I didn't think I would say this, but I prefer organizing my music with the Zune software over X-Box Music. Zune software is does not work with WP8.I am happy with my decision to switch to Nokia Lumia 810. I think Nokia did a fine job of designing this phone. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 22:33:35	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
65906539	I have used this phone for almost 20 months and this is the worst phone I have ever had.  It over heats, freezes and requires battery removal to reboot it.  The battery lasts maybe 6 hours on a full charge, if I'm lucky.  It will text a picture if and when it wants to.  The dimmer works on the screen some days, but not others.  The vibration mode is broken now.  Even if it's free, it's like not having a phone with all of the issues.  Do not buy this lousy product. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 22:33:35	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

66248315	I realize this review site is for the Net 10 Huawei Ascend, but since I have the same phone from Page Plus I thought I would share my thoughts. I purchased this phone from Page Plus Cellular which uses the Verizon network. So far the phone is very nice. My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy S2 phone on the VirginMobile / Sprint network. The Samsung phone would reset itself constantly and the it damaged my SD card also the Sprint network at my location was terrible. So back to the Huawei Ascend Plus, screen is bright, has a nice rubberized feel. First thing to do which this phone is to install a SD Card! I installed a 32gb micro sd card. Remove back cover and you will see the install location above the battery. Next set the phone to use the SD card for the apps instead of the internal memory) THIS IS A MUST WITH THIS PHONE! due to its low internal memory. Just go to settings, storage and click on default storage location and set it for SD Card. Next I set the phone to connect to my home wi-fi and downloaded  26 of my favorite apps. There is an app called Super tool box 10+. Use it, it will clear your cache, free your memory and do many more things for free. I've used it for years on all my android phones. Now back to the phone. Phone is fast and works perfectly so far! MP3 player sounds great, I use the Poweramp app for music. Videos play well, I use the free MX player for videos. (Set it to use SW codec). The phone only handles 3G data , but on the Verizon network it blows away my old Sprint network. Phone calls are clear and I am now connected in areas I could not get a connection before. This Phone with the Verizon network just works well!UPDATE: Still using the micro SD card I am up to 34 apps on my 5 screens + the apps that came with the phone that I don't use. I've added 2x battery for power saving (shuts on and off the data at a frequency that you select) I've added super keyboard app (I feel it is a better keyboard than what came with the phone) I added Zedge app which gives many many ringtones to choose and more. Phone Reception monitor that give me a digital read out of the Verizon cell signal. I added Waze which may be the best GPS app out on the android market. Who says this phone doesn't hold much!! And its still fast and working great! Don't forget to open Super tool box and run and erase your cache from time to tome. Love this phone with the Verizon network!Second UPDATE: I am now well over 40 apps with NO PROBLEMS. My internal memory ram for apps is at 250mb. I am impressed with the battery life! Blows away my old Samsung S11. I bought a 4.2 volt Life Tech battery charger (which is the max voltage for this Huawei Ascend Plus H881c battery) Just remove the back of the phone, and battery,  insert the pins of the charger on the + and - of the battery (polarity does not matter the charge will adjust)When the charge stops blinking you are charged. I purchased an extra battery and now I switch them in the morning before going to work. To show how long it lasts, I put the phone on my belt at 4:30am and check emails, listen to my music etc while com-mutating to work at 12:10pm lunch time I am at 98%. Crazy good!Third Update July 2014:I have used this phone as a MP3 player using poweramp app (best music app on google playstore) , GPS using Waze, Phone calls, Maps, remote starting of my GM car using the onstar app, cheap gas finder using gas buddy app, screen flash light using flashlight app, company emails and my yahoo and gmail messages, texting, calculators using office calculator app, sports scores using the cbs sports app, wireless bluetooth music to my wireless headphones, internet browser on Verizon 3g and wifi, train tickets using NJ transit mytix app, camera pictures and video taking and saved to gallery, youtube and movie videos using mx player app, banking using various banking apps, weather monitoring with the NOAA weather app, Built in FM radio, games like tetris app, PdaNet for tethering to your laptop, IP Cam Viewer to monitor, view and control my home security cameras (very cool), google playstore to get the best apps. Did I miss anything? All this and not 1 reset !!! Other phones I had would auto shutoff and reset from time to time. Still very pleased with this phone! 	jwilets	10-25-2015 22:49:06	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

The apps are lacking still, and the ones they do have are generally beta versions riddled with bugs, that will just cause you annoyance.

For what I want it to do (primarily texting and social media), the phone is simple to use, and after a week of use, I absolutely adore it!The only thing I don't care for is the battery life. I'd read reviews that it wasn't good, but it is terrible.  I'm a heavy texter and use social media throughout the day, but still....I'd expected a fully-charged battery to last longer than 12 hours, which is typically when I need to plug the phone says battery is critcally low and I need to charge it.Otherwise, I'm very impressed with this phone and love it!! 	jwilets	10-25-2015 22:51:57	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66352848	I purchased the product to have an unlocked phone when traveling abroad, which I do many times a year.  The phone worked for less than two month before, for no reason (never dropped, submerged, etc, the phone), the phone stopped turning on due to hardware issues.  When I called Samsung, they told me that unlocked phones are NOT eligible for warranty.  This policy is Samsung-specific (Apple, for instance, honors warranties regardless of sales channel).  I have had other smart phones (Blackberry, iPhone, HTC, etc) for many years and have never seen a phone malfunction so quickly.  CAVEAT EMPTOR - SAMSUNG PHONES HAVE MAJOR QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES.  BUYING AN UNLOCKED PHONE ONLINE VOIDS THE ONE-YEAR WARRANTY.In terms of the phone itself, it runs extremely slowly.  I'm not sure if it's the service provider or phone itself.  I've used the phone in France on the Sfr Network, USA on the ATT; Network, in England on the Vodaphone Network, and in Spain on the Orange Network (all pre-paid service) in the lt;2 months that the phone worked.  Of these places it worked best in the UK but data speed was still significantly slower than my iPhone on ATT; in New York.  The screen resolution is so poor, you won't be able to read anything on the 3.5 screen without enlarging the text.  The phone itself feels plasticky/chincy.  I would consider HTC for higher end Android phones.  For lower end phones, there are better options from Motorola or others.  Avoid Samsung phones at all costs from a 1) customer service, 2) quality perspective, and 3) functionality perspective (at least lower end smart phones). 	jakeg6	10-25-2015 22:52:27	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

The most frustrating part is that Verizon released it before there were any cases ready for it, so I am using it unprotected.  Overall it's a good phone for the price.

27694416	This phone is the best phone I have ever owned. I came from the HTC Trophy and the Motorola droid before that. I really like both phones but this one is an incredible feature packed unit. Some complain about the weight but that was a non issue for me, I thought that the device might be too big for my pockets but the curved shape of the phone allowed for comfortable storage.I cannot say enough about this phone, camera is amazing, the screen is the best I have ever seen on a smart phone, I love Windows Phone OS, the microphones are great, Nokia software is top notch.Durability was a big factor for me, that is why I like the Droid so much. I saw what people do to this phone online (search Lumia 920 torture test) and It sold me on the quality of the device. The Engineers spent many hours crafting a beautiful device, I am not going to ruin that with a case, and with this phone I don't have to worry about it.I am not an appaholic so the marketplace is of perfect size for me. I have my casual games and Xbox integration along with connection to my work environment so it does everything I need without force closing randomly (hmm Android).I work in IT and people ask how I like it and If they should get one. I tell them that it is worth a try and If you just want something that works fluidly then this is a product they should seriously consider. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 22:58:06	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

My goal was to turn off Iphone which I was paying 30.00 for internet and try to knock down my bill from Verizon. I got the phone on the day they said I would get it, charged the battery for an hour(reached full charge in 40 min) drove to Verizon and they activated  it in 60 seconds. Phone works fine and I've had no problems. Texting works fine. I am now saving 30.00 a month. In fact I have had the phone over a week an have yet to charge it.  I was really nervous about buying this phone. Expected a piece of crap but got a workable phone at a good price. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 23:01:34	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

20112629	I don't expect a lot of these phones so what I received is what I expected. These phones are sturdy and well made but are quiet simple to operate. However, that being said, there is a learning curve so don't think you will simply insert a SIM card and be making calls moments later. Take a moment to look over the owner's manual just to get a sense of the phone's operation. You will certainly save yourself a lot of time by reviewing the manual. I have owned a lot of phones over the last twenty years and I found this phone to be pretty much in line with lower end cell phones. But this is a dual SIM phone and therefor requires a few more settings than your typical cell phone. Read the manual! You WILL have to input your PIN number every time you cycle your phone on and off.I had a few problems while using this phone but must admit some of this was due to the SIM card I was using. Make sure to select a good SIM card for the phone and the region you are going to. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 23:03:05	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

The feedback from my friend is nothing but positives. This phone priced at $150 is basically on par with other $400 price range ones. It's a steal. The shipping from this vendor is super fast, 3 days in total from the time I place order on Amazon and to when I receive it. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 23:04:01	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
33575641	It is absolutely fantastic! I love it. I found out some inconveniences like battery and storage. if you love to play games the whole day day in your cell phone,well, get a small and comfortable charger to take everywhere with you. If you are not a gamer, well the battery will stand for a complete day, even more than 12 hours. It will get hot also, not burn your skin if you use a good cover though. Finally, the only #34;big inconvenience#34; is storage. you will only have 8GB two or three movies will fill this phone  up. I will recommend you to get the 16GB version. I guess manufacturers has discovered that not putting SD card slot will help to maintain a good performance at all time of the cellphone. Other than these inconveniences, phone is very cool and for this price fantastic! 	jwilets	10-25-2015 23:04:01	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66747964	DESIGN: Although design of a phone is mostly opinion on whether it's good or not, I personally think the design is near perfect. The glass is very sturdy on both the front and back, the buttons are spaced nicely and have great tactile feedback, the crystal pattern behind the back glass panel is amazing to just look at it, and the bezels around the screen are nice and thin. Some smart phones even in 2014 just can't compete with this design.DURABILITY: I dropped this phone on concrete thirty minutes after I bought it. Not a single scratch after I picked it up. The backing, being glass, might worry you, but it's definitely strong. I never cracked this phone, though after awhile it did gather a few scratches. I never felt the need to put the G in a case, just because it didn't need one for me. The phone can get slippery since it's manily glass, so you might drop it until you form a good grip position through practiceSPEED: Even with one of the first quad core mobile chips, this thing is still fast enough for newer games and multitasking. Try slowing the phone down, you'll have a tough time doing so. The 2GB of RAM give plenty of breathing room while running many apps and four cores makes doing so a breeze.SOFTWARE: LG's Optimus UI 3.0 Software is sort of a Love it or Hate it situation. It takes a lot from TouchWiz on Galaxy devices and adds a few things. Some love it some don't. I personally prefer it over a Samsung device, it just feels smoother.DISPLAY: Even at only 1280x768 this display is amazing to use. 4.7 inches in size isn't too big or too small for average sized hands, but that's opinion. Colors look great, a little bit colder than on other devices, but natural looking and bright. The device has a PPI of over 300 so it is very sharp, small text is easy to read and viewing angles are good enough that you won't notice distortion until you really tilt the phone at a crazy angle.BATTERY: Rated at 2100mAh, the battery is decently sized. It holds up somewhat nicely, but it wasn't mind blowing. Expect to get through the day with heavy usage, but don't expect more than maybe ten or eleven hours. The screen and processor are probably a bit too much for the battery to healthily handle, and a larger battery would have been a better idea for greater than mediocre battery life. It works, but could be higherCONCLUSION: Since the battery can last all day it isn't really an issue, and everything else is just amazing. The only deal breaker here is software, so try the phone put if you can before buying. There is no SD expansion so you get 32GB with the Sprint/International models and that's it. ATT; have a different design model with SD expansion, but I personally like the Sprint one more. That is also merely my opinion, but this phone overall gets the 9.5 out of 10 from me. Near perfect, just mediocre battery that takes away half of a point. Highly recommend this extremely underrated device. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 23:04:01	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
66102540	The Samsung Galaxy S3 could arguably the best smart phone on the market. The Samsung Galaxy S3 can call, text, watch movies, surf the internet, take pictures, transfer data and much more. The Galaxy S3, successor to the Galaxy S2, which is a touch screen phone designed and sold by Samsung electronics, appeared in the market May 29, 2012.Lets take a look at why the S3 can be the best smart phone on the market today. First, it has an outstandingly huge 4.8 Super AMOLED screen (Samsung Electronics). If you don't know what that is, its screen is 4.8 inches diagonally across the 1280x720 pixel display (Samsung Electronics). With its huge screen, this phone is relatively big in the hand. Measuring in at 136.6 millimeters tall, 70.6 millimeters wide, and 8.6 millimeters thick, it is advised you get a hold of one before purchasing (Samsung Electronics). It is also 133 grams, almost .3 pounds, which is very light considering its large body. This smart phone comes in a sixteen or thirty two gigabytes of internal memory, which can also be expanded with a micro SD card (Samsung Electronics).It has two cameras, one eight mega pixel rear camera with LED flash, auto focus, and image stability. The eight mega pixel camera is standard, a twelve mega pixel camera would be more fitting since there are already phones like the HTC Titan 2 which has a twelve mega pixel camera or the Nokia Pureview 808 with a whopping forty one mega pixel camera. The Galaxy S3's eight mega pixel camera is so outdated. The front facing camera is 1.9 mega pixels, nothing fancy. The Galaxy S3 has a big 2,100 milliamp battery which will keep your phone running for days on a single charge, definitely a great feature of the phone. Finally, you can get this incredible phone in a pebble blue color or a marble white color.The Galaxy S3's top competitor is Apples Iphone 5, now the second best selling US phone after the Galaxy S3. The Galaxy S3 is 136.6x70.6x8.6 millimeters while the Iphone 5 measures 123.8x58.6x7.6 millimeters (Apple Inc.). The S3 weighs 133 grams verses the Iphone's 112 grams (Apple Inc.). The weight difference is due to the Galaxy S3's big body. Even though it is a lot bigger than the Iphone, the weight is relatively light for such a big phone. The S3 boosts a 4.8 inch display, while the Iphone 5 only has a four inch screen. The point eight inches makes all the difference, since when you look at the screen, its screen length is proportional to the screen width the Iphone 5's screen is much too tall compared to its width.The body of the Samsung is made entirely of plastic, which doesn't feel very high quality when holding it. Also, it can easily slip out of the hand because of the glossy plastic finish. Its battery cover is also made of flimsy plastic, not high quality at all. Spending two hundred dollars with contract for this phone, you would think it should be more toughly built. The Iphone 5 on the other hand, has a metal casing with an aluminum backing. It sure feels sturdy and well made in the hand. While the metal and aluminum both contribute to its sturdy build, there is a drawback. The aluminum backing is very easily scratched (Williams par18). The Iphone's size is also more hands friendly, its slim design makes it easier to hold and use with one hand than the Galaxy S3.One of the great features of the Galaxy which trumps Iphone's is its removable battery. So, when the battery runs out of holding its charge, all you have to do is purchase a new battery. Whereas with the Iphone, you would have to buy a whole new phone. Another incredible feature on the S3 is its incredible battery life. Because of its big body, Samsung was able to fit a big battery in. The S3's 2,100 milliamp battery will really last you a while (Samsung Electronics). I have used it heavily texting, calling, and surfing the web all day, and it can still last me two days on a single charge. Although I don't have much playing time with the Iphone 5, I know it has a 1,440 milliamp battery (Apple Inc.). Its significantly less than the Galax S3's, and not as great because it is non-removable.The Galaxy S3 and the Iphone 5 both have an eight mega pixel rear camera with led flash, high definition video recording, auto focus, and image stability. What sets them apart with cameras is their front facing camera. The Iphone only has a 1.2 mega pixel front camera, nothing special (Apple Inc.). The S3 has a 1.9 mega pixel front camera, way clearer images for when you want to take self portraits or use it as a mirror. As for the colors of the phone, the Iphone 5 comes in white or black, while the Samsung Galaxy S3 comes in blue or white (Samsung Electronics).When we go under the hood of the smart phones, one is android and the other is IOS. The Galaxy S3 runs android Ice Cream Sandwich, and the Iphone 5 runs IOS 6. If you like to customize your phone, the S3 will let you do that. On the other hand, if you want a phone that is easy to navigate, the Iphone 5 is the way to go. The Galaxy S3 can run more applications more smoothly than the Iphone can. The S3 has two gigabytes of RAM, while the Iphone only has one gigabyte (Samsung Electronics) (Apple Inc.). If multitasking is your thing, the S3 can run all of your needs more smoothly than the Iphone. Some more benefits of choosing the Samsung Galaxy S3 is its NFC capability (Samsung Electronics). It uses Near Field Communication to transfer data quickly by simply tapping two NFC capable devices together. That's instantaneous data transfer. Also, the Galaxy S3 boosts Smart Stay and Direct Call (Samsung Electronics). Using the front facing camera, smart stay tracks your eye movements and keeps the screen bright. It only turns off the screen when you are asleep or not looking at the device anymore. Now, usually if you want to call someone, you have to go to your contacts to find the person you want to call, but with Direct Call, it is as simple as putting your phone to your ear. Say you are texting someone, and you want to call them instead. All you have to do is put your phone to your ear, and the S3 will automatically call that person. Sadly, none of these features are present on the Iphone 5.When reviewing the Samsung Galaxy S3, you quickly realize that this phone is a lot different than any other phone in the market. When comparing it to the Iphone 5, they both have strong points as well as weak spots, but you can clearly see that the Galaxy S3 is better than the Iphone. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 23:06:38	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

I charge mine in the morning while I get ready for the day or if I charge it at night I make sure I don't have it plugged past the point of the battery being charged.

64234307	I bought a Moto G 4G LTE 8 gig to replace my trouble plagued currently non operating HTC One X, which is technically a high end phone. The Moto is not a high end phone, but it is solid and well made, and has a quad processor that is at least as fast as the HTC. The screen, while a bit smaller than the HTC, is clear and bright. It has a bigger battery and smart battery software that lasts far longer than the HTC's. Where the Moto g really shines is in it's operating system. Android Kit Kat is integrated to the Moto's hardware like IOS is integrated to an iphone. There is no fuzzy add-on like HTC Sense to get between Android and you, and the new Android 4.4 is actually elegant. It's simple and intuitive. When have you heard someone say that about Android? Lastly, If you use gmail and other Google features like Calendar, the Moto g is a perfect match.

66119116	My niece has a good working Net10 phone that I buy minutes for all the time, so I thought I'd pick one up for my husband and I.  Here's my horror story.I picked up this model in Walmart on a Thursday.  I had to bring it back the following day because the back cover that was included in the clamshell case was THE WRONG ONE, and WOULDN'T FIT.  The girls behind the counter had a little laugh as they opened up 3 more of the same model cases until they found a back cover that would fit it, and I went back home with it a second time.I plugged it in that afternoon, hoping for a powerup by sometime that evening, but nothing.  The following morning, Saturday, still nothing.Completely disgusted, I returned to Walmart that same day and just returned it.If this is any indication of the quality of present Net10 phones, I'm having nothing to do with it, and am, unfortunately very gun-shy about any of them from any manufacturer at the present time. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 23:10:51	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
40024049	It's much better than what I had expected. The phone's screen is big and seems very sturdy. I really like the tiles concept of the windows phone. The big screen really helps my aging eyes. The phone takes good photos day and night as well. Setting up e-mail is easy.However, there are some cons:1. The camera button is either extremely hard to press or the response time is too slow. I just can't get a handle on whether the picture was actually taken or not. I look later to find that some photos weren't taken because of the inconsistent button.2. The 'Bing' tab on the lower right hand side of the screen seems so sensitive that even the slightest touch, brings up a new Bing screen for searching the net. Just wish this button was for the camera instead (at least I wouldn't miss shots)3. Once your directed to a new internet page, i.e. via  facebook or other applications, you can't get back to that particular application unless you exit and tap the application anew. - i.e. you can't get back to the spot in facebook that launched the internet page. You start reading again from the top!As for quality of materials and hardware, It's a very good phone altogether. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 23:10:51	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64076064	It's not that this is a bad phone. It just had a lot of glitches, freeze spots, processor slow-downs, etc. I guess Sony Ericsson didn't quite test this one as well as it should have. There are plenty of free phones out there, but avoid this one. It has an updated counterpart, if you want to look into that. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 23:10:51	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

37031685	This is one of the best phones I used in a while. I've had an iPhone 3.x and 4.x and the Nokia 900 over the past few years... and I really like each one of those phones.  But, the Nokia 920 blows them all away!  It feels solid in your hand.  The screen is crisp and clear to read... even outside.  The price point is absolutely unbelievable!  The camera takes fantastic pictures!  Wireless charging is something you won't be able to live without after you get it!  I went for the Yellow 920 and I couldn't be happier.  I love the glossy finish! Aside from feeling solid, it just feels nice to the touch!  I'm very happy I didn't choose an extra row of icons, never mind the extra cost (the iPhone 5) over the Nokia 920!  If you been considering going with a Windows Phone, you just need to go do it!  You won't be sorry! 	jakeg6	10-25-2015 23:12:19	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
6736837	This company is selling products refurbished as new, I got this phone and the display had a flickering issue I decided to live with that problem, 3 months later touch screen stops working I called to On The Go Solutions and they told me to contact Nokia support, Nokia support told me that this phone was manufactured at Africa, for that reason they will not honor warranty.In one word I wasted 330 dollars + shipping. 	jakeg6	10-25-2015 23:12:19	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Display		false

I'm now giving the phone to ,y mother, for her to use, and have upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S3, which I highly recommend as well. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 23:13:18	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

She picked it out it doesn't load well its obsolete in a lot of it's functions, It was an overall disappointment and I also bought the rhino armor case/holster  it doesn't even fit the phone its too long for the phone!! As for the rating of this phone it doesn't even get a half of a star, It's really a disgrace to the Samsung galaxy s 3 only thing they have in common is the color.

64267328	16-Jan-2007Feedback about Nokia 6682 phone based on my personal experiencePros:1) The menu keys are fully customizable  in standby mode. i.e. You can customize what you want to access with the essential keys, when your phone is not in use. Remember when you are in a call, the phone has its own preset assignments to these keys, which I don't think could be customized. So this is only applicable when the phone is in standby.You can customize the left selection key, right selection key, up menu key, down menu key, right menu key and left menu key to your own requirements. Customizing 6 keys for my own requirement was more than enough to quickly access all my favorite menu items.You have a variety of options to choose from in order to assign which key does what.For example I have assigned the keys as follows:Left selection key  =&gt; CameraRight selection key  =&gt; Profiles (where I can choose what is the current profile for my phone i.e. Loud, silent, mild - remember the profiles themselves are customizable. i.e. You can create your own profiles as you wish).Down menu key  =&gt; ContactsUp menu key  =&gt; Clock (where I can set the alarm etc.)Right menu key  =&gt; Phone settings (where I can assign which keys to do which function)Left menu key  =&gt; Call logsMenu center key  =&gt; Gallery (See comment # 9 in cons about Menu center key)CUSTOMIZE your keys!!! Though it takes some time this provides you the freedom you want with the phone and believe me it is worth the time!2) The profiles are customizable (See my related note above) and you can create your own profile. OK, you ask what is a profile? Profile is how you choose your phone's behavior. For example 'Loud' could be a profile where you can customize your phone's behavior for an incoming call, messages, key presses etc. Say in 'Loud' profile you can choose to make the phone ring loud for an incoming call, beep loudly for incoming messages, beep on key presses, vibrate on an incoming call etc. You can create your own profile and assign it your favorite name.3) The phone has a separate 'backspace' key. So when you punched something wrong (Say a phone number) you can simply use the backspace key to erase one character at a time.4) The phone has a separate menu key. To access the menu you simply press that menu key on the bottom left. But since I have customized the functionality of 6 of the other keys (as mentioned above) I rarely have the necessity to access the phone's menu per se.5) Separate 'voice command' key on the left side of the phone. To dial someone by voice, just press and hold that button and then speak the name of the person etc. to call their number.6) Nice camera. The pictures I took have come out pretty good so far. And of course you can use those pictures as a wall paper on your phone.7) Though the keys are small, they are so precise smooth and nice to press, you don't have any problems dialing a number etc.8) Great silvery look9) Of course, a separate memory card slot where you can insert your memory card filled with whatever you want to. Music, pictures, videos and all those nice stuff. How much you store is up to you. Of course more you want to store, you need a higher capacity memory card.10) The hands free that comes with the phone is really good, though it is a bit long and I haven't figured out how to shorten it using the adjusters provided. The stereo effect when you talk is pretty good. You will really enjoy it.11) Of course, the blue tooth. I haven't found any issues with it. I have a logitech blue tooth. It took some time for me to figure out how to use it, but once you get hooked to it, nothing like the blue tooth freedom. I haven't tested the limits of the blue tooth with this phone, but you do get those disturbances once you start moving away from the phone. But that is the price to pay for the wireless freedom I guess. Also sometimes people say that they hear some clicking (or other) sound while talking on the blue tooth set, but that problem isn't unique to this phone.12) Sturdy: Yes, the phone is a bit bulky. But that in turn means that is robust and sturdy, particularly for a person like me, who doesn't really handle it very gently! It fits nicely into the pant pocket.13) Key pad lock: Since this isn't a flip phone, it is essential that the key pad of the phone be locked before you put it inside your pocket. Otherwise you can make unintended calls to random numbers! Locking the key pad is the same as any other Nokia phone. To lock the keypad simply press the left selection key and then press the star key. To unlock do the same again.Note: Because of the fact the left selection key enables the lock feature, you will notice a delay when you use the left selection key to access the functionality to which you have assigned it. This is because when you press the left selection key, the phone doesn't really know if you are trying to lock the key pad or if you are trying to access the menu. After a couple of seconds if you didn't press the star key, then the menu item will show up.Cons: (all cons are of low severity level)1) I haven't figured out a way to 'Auto lock' the key pad of the phone (say after a few minutes of inactivity). I know there should be a way. I will call Nokia to find how to do that.2) Sometimes I mistakenly press the power button on the right side, while trying to hold the phone and the phone switches off!3) Vibrating feature isn't that great. It is just sufficient enough I guess.4) The camera shutter cover is very smooth and sensitive. So sometimes when I put the phone into my pant pocket, it opens because it slides the opposite side. To prevent this, always try to put the phone bottom first into the pocket, since that will mean you will be pushing the camera cover up, which is what you do to close it.5) It is always not obvious that whenever you are in a menu, you can see that there are several options available to you on the top. These options could be accessed by using the right and left menu key to scroll through the options. Though this is a pro, the reason I am putting it under 'con' is that this isn't very obvious, until you notice it carefully or get used to it.For example if you got a missed call from the same number three times continuously, the call times of all 3 calls won't be obvious to you in the 'missed call' history, since it only shows the time of the last call attempt from that number.But if you carefully notice when you are in the 'call log' there will be a 'notepad' like icon to which you can scroll using your right menu key to access all the call history. Here you will be able to get the time of all the missed calls from the same number. I wish they gave it directly in the call log.6) The phone always remembers the last menu you accessed and will go deep into the menu the next time you open it. This could be a pro or con depending on your personal preferences. Say you accessed your 'call log' last time and you browsed through 'received calls', the next time you access the 'call log' it will DIRECTLY go to the 'received calls' page. But this time you might have wanted to access the 'missed calls' menu. So you will have to go back one step and navigate forward to the 'missed calls' menu.It might take some time to get used to this.7) I don't think you can make the phone display to be on as long as you want to do so. It always times out after a few minutes of course for power saving. I guess it has a 1 minute limit.8) I wish they had a separate volume up and down button may be on the side of the phone. Rather you have to use the left and right menu key for that when you are talking.9) The 'Menu center key' is not very accessible, in the sense it is hard to push it down. Rather most of the time you try to push it down, you end up pressing the up menu key or the down menu key. So the 'Menu center key' isn't that easy to access.10) I wish there was also a 'separate loud speaker key', which I could simply press if I want to put the phone on the speaker mode. Unfortunately there isn't one. Hence you have to use the menu key to access the speaker, while talking.11) You cannot initiate the phone dialing directly from the speaker mode. i.e. You cannot access the speaker mode when the phone is on standby. So if you want to be on speaker, you always have to make the call and then go to the speaker mode from the menu.Other notes:Nokia 6682 user guide: [...]How long have I used the phone? 1.5 monthsI will add more pros and cons if I find out more!Data capabilities: I haven't used the phone for much of its data capabilities for which it is known for. So I am unable to comment on those data features. So it goes without saying that I use the phone mostly for its 'voice features'. That begs the question, 'Am I making full use of this phone and its features'. The answer is a loud 'No'. And the question is 'If you are not using the data capabilities at all' do you really need this phone? I don't have a straightforward answer to that question. It depends on your personal preferences. But if you want that option included this is the phone to go with. But even if you only want a great voice conversation this is a great phone.Where did I buy the phone? Amazon.comImportant note about buying at amazon.com : If you buy this (or any other cingular network) phone through amazon.com and you are switching from another network, then note that amazon doesn't provide number portability. For example if you currently using 'T-Mobile' and want to switch over to 'Cingular' and want to buy this phone on amazon.com, then you cannot retain your old phone number. Amazon.com will assign their own phone number once you place your order. After getting the phone, you might be able to port the old phone number (provided you haven't cancelled your T-Mobile or other account) by directly talking to Cingular. But here is the catch - if you port your old phone number directly by talking to Cingular (by passing Amazon.com) then you are breaking the 'Terms and conditions' of Amazon.com, which means you will be required to pay '$250' to Amazon.com for changing your phone number. This is applicable until 6 months after you buy the phone. After 6 months you can change the phone number. But it is a no brainer that no one wants to change their number in 6 months again!Disclaimer:The information I have provided above is based on my own personal experience of using this phone. Individual experiences may vary from one person to another.Have a nice customization!Karthikeyan Arunachalam 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 23:13:18	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

Within 2  days my daughters phone unuseable except in certain spots in her home, where she had no problems with the cheap throw away she was using before. My phone had to be reset within a week of activation and while it solved the problems at the time they have returned and are worse.Both phones can be replaced but we must accept used phones. So we give up a new phone with a problem and are offered someone else's problem in the form of a refurb unit even though the problems occurred when these phones were  less then 2 weeks old.I was interested in an ipad but after having this experience with TWO Apple products I will be getting a Kindle Fire. 	jakeg6	10-25-2015 23:16:55	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	Replacement	Operating System	Internal Hardware		false

66779375	Greetings... I purchased one of these from ATT; in December, and gave it a whirl.  I had similar problems to many others:1) Poor battery life-  I need a charger at home and work, as the thing could not make it all day2) Gets hot during use, especially video use3) OUTRAGEOUS and totally inexplicable data usage.  THIS IS MY #1 PROBLEM  with the Lumia 920...After complaining to ATT;, they swapped out one 920 for a new one.  The same problems persisted.  After speaking with both ATT; techs (on-line and in ATT; service store), as well as contacting Nokia, I could not get the problems resolved, particularly any explanation for the CRAZY data usage.  The thing sits on my desk most of the day, on my company Wi-Fi, and at home it is on Wi-Fi.  It is NOT supposed to use up your data plan while on wi-fi-- however, I would get bills from ATT; showing as much as 11 GIGAbytes of use in 1 month.  And here's the deal-- after speaking with ATT;, Nokia, and reading on various web sites, I disabled or removed every application anyone could think of that used data (other than Internet explorer and email).  No Facebook.  No live tiles.  No maps.  No Nokia Driving app.  No backups or photos/vids to Skydrive.  No weather app. etc. etc.  But ATT; still claimed seeing data bursts and spikes throughout the day of sometimes 80Mb... they could not explain any of these bursts (especially since I was supposed to be on Wi-Fi) and quickly refunded ALL of the overage charges on my account for 3 months...which in itself is suspicious (you ever try getting a refund from a phone company?)...Anyway, I finally got ATT; to swap the Nokia Lumia 920 for a Samsung Galaxy S III- which includes a data usage application... and in one week of having the Galaxy it has used less data than one day of the Lumia 920.  With the same email accounts configured.  And usings the Samsung data use app, I could see that one 4 minute YouTube video used about 50Mb of data, and email uses very little.  So it appears to me that both Lumia 920's that I had were in some way defective.I liked the device in terms of appearance, apps, ease of use-- the Windows 8 was pretty nice, the screen is beautiful, and it otherwise worked well.  However, I can't afford to hand ATT; $110/month in overage fees for data I don't choose to use.  And a 4 - 6 hour battery life on a device with this large a battery is also pretty unacceptable.  Oh well Nokia-- this is called by some your last chance gadget.  Maybe it's your last gasp...If Nokia acknowledges issues and FIXES THEM, either via software updates, or replacing hardware, this would be a 5 star device.  As it is in my experience, I give it 3 stars because not everyone appears to be having the issues I had, and the problems MAY be resolvable by future updates. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 23:20:05	Comparison	Performance Defect	Both	Replacement	Operating System	Internal Hardware		false
66126061	The product was in great condition but our Verizon plan required us to upgrade to a data package so we had to return it.  The return was very easy and our account was credited.  We ended up purchasing another phone from this group that didn't require the data plan upgrade and are very happy. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 23:20:05	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
66523595	I own this Kin Two phone because it is 8 mega pixel camera (try that with your lame Iphone) and FREE WI FI!!! How awesome is that?!I don't know if you can download APPs other than from the Verizon store online. (I think it's possible... I think a customer service rep tried to convince me of that... as if it was important to me?)FREE WI FI8 Mega Pixel CameraNO MEMORY CARD but 8G, so it's pretty nice. AND a USB cord to share your microsoft windows.-typical low battery life of smart phones.Mine lasts a few hours, not a few days. This could be a manufacture error. I am not sure. ?+My Favorite: this has one of the highest quality affordable Mega pixel cameras that I can find on the market! you go ahead and search) 5 Megapixels is nothing to scoff at ! Iphone does not have 8 mega pixels! This thing is amazing! This has free wi fi (where the bubble is available in the coffe shop or library, etc). FREE RADIO function available using your headphones as metal antenna. THis radio function is available in Airplane mode (it is NOT online!) . Pause LIVE RADIO! How wonderful is that? This is a super fun little email device! AND, if you get tired of email AND internet surfing, AND * * * ZUNE * * * MP3 music or streaming, one can actually use this for Text or PHONE! Yes, that's right! It's a PHONE too! How wonderful!!!This phone is similar to Kin One but it is missing the clip where you could put a lanyard. This would be neat for the Zune function. I guess you could drill or melt a hole in the plastic battery cover, the clip is there, but not in the cover? so odd.It has some quirks.But it has...FREE WI FI!It is called the dumbest smart phone. I am not even sure it is a smart phone at all. But I do like the camera feature! !!! No third party APPs. avail. There is no SD memory card. However, you can attach the USB direct to your computer to download and share Windows viruses back and forth. try Linux OS.maybe someone can jail break the software on this phone. I get tired of looking at strangers' faces each time it lights up (which does take a really long time, . This is my first smart phone so what do I know?) I've used my friend's Iphone and I'm not impressed with Iphones.I think I'm going back to my old feature phone.Too bad, this thing texts very quickly with the pull out keyboard. I like the feel of the little bubble letters. Cute! Is there _ button?+FREE WI FI  no  need to buy data plan. if you sit in a coffee house or University library all day, or pay for wi fi at your home.+This phone works for me!+Even if you use the thrifty Pay-as-you-go plan, at the lowest possible denomination, $15 per month, if you talk every other day , $1 on days when phone is active , a person can talk ALL DAY ::: free Verizon to Verizon for $1! ALL DAY! This price can not be beat! Cute little text was only ten cents and does not activate the $1 per day fee! So, $15 is ... 150* text messages! I think that should be plenty sufficient, but I don't have a teenager in my house yet, either! ; ).25 for picture messages... with this retro beautiful streamlined bubble shape phone, I imagine there will be lots of awesome photos to share with family and friends!-/+ GPS locator,yes-/+ PS. I was told there was no calendar (?! are they serious? and no alarm clock on the old old style , but now there is an APP, so no worries!! The Kin cloud data media online website is closed. Shrugs. I don't get it. One can still access all the important social media websites via web browser, which... by the way...Did I mention?+FREE WI FI !+FREE!+Wi Fi!-(due to the closing of Kin website) Who wants a geo locator tag on the photos anyway? that's uber creepy!

37848897	I purchased this phone because of its tablet capabilities as well as the fact that the Samsung Galaxy series in my opinion is equal to or out performs the iPhone. There is nothing the iPhone can do that my new Galaxy Note 2 can't.You got to try the tablet capabilities for yourself because it alone will give you more features than you can ever use.A hint is to go online and look at some of he featured videos for this phone prior to purchasing it.I am a launcher critic for most cell phones but Samsung provided launcher is pretty good; in fact you won't get much more by changing to a new launcher.I thought this thing would be just too big because I carry my phone in my pants pocket, but I tried my daughter's Note 2 and it fit very well into the pocket. When I purchased mind I immediately put on Speck protective case and it slid in and out of my pocket with no problems at all.I've got to say that it looks huge for a cell phone but it works great functionally and physically.Checkout the positive reviews for this phone the negative reviews are people that will find a problem with anything and nothing is perfect for everyone. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 23:23:26	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

It sent me the update automatically for Ice Cream Sandwich, and it comes with a charger, and headphones in the box. I say this because these were the things I was unsure of when I made my purchase and I live in the Caribbean, so I have the unlocked version.

27374475	We did not know that this phone would not work with the Verizon network in the US. There is nothing that stated that before or at the time of purchase. Because the phone was manufactured in the UK, the US Samsung cannot help us. Wireless Everything is only open during the weekdays so if you are trying to get help, you can't do it on the weekends. This has all been very frustrating because although the order was shipped in the time that was promised, it does not actually work with Verizon. There are certain codes that are needed for unlocked phones, and with Verizon it is very hard to obtain the proper codes.

65786790	I really like this phone.  I bought it because I had work in South Africa for 3 months and needed something that I could put a local sim card in.  I like this phone so much that I think I will keep it and use it when I get back to the States.-Calls are both reliable and clear which I think is the most important thing(it is a phone first after all)-The keyboard takes some getting used to but I think I now prefer it to either a qwerty(takes up too much space w/ too small of buttons for fingers like mine), a touch screen(same finger problem) or a regular keypad.  I don't have excessively large hands but I def do have man hands so I find many things are not built with me in mind.  If this is not your case then you can disregard this part but I find that many of the men I work with and my friends tend to have similar issues.-I didn't really want a flip phone either but now that I have one I am becoming a fan(no pocket dialing or key locking etc.)-Battery life is good.  I turned on the music player and left it on speaker to see how long it would take to drain the thing and after 4 hrs and less than half the battery gone gave up.-Camera isn't that great but is more than adequate for a phone like this.-I like that I can turn off data services and keep wi-fi on so that I don't get clipped in the US for a blackberry plan and can still use data from wi-fi(obviously not as great if you don't have regular wi-fi spots but if data is that important to you then you can always purchase the plan)-The screen isn't that big(it is more than adequate though)  It is bright and crisp-Interface is good and I like having a smaller phone with the blackberry ball-Music production quality is really good and doesn't drain the battery(see above) plus the ability to expand the memory is nice.-Basic memory included is really not adequate if you are going to actually use this as a blackberry or music phone but I picked up a microSD 4gb for less than $10 and am so far happy so plan on buying a card-Phone seems pretty durable but I haven't had it that long so I will update this as I go-I have read some reviews about the phone being to slow or not working etc. I think this is prob a hardware issue that would be covered as long as you buy one with a warranty.  I think it is also the effect of the 1 in 1000 customers who get a bad phone to be unhappy enough to write a review while 999 ppl who are content won't.-This is NOT a smartphone but it does do what you need it too.  Personally I don't want a phone that is too big just so I can do inadequate work on it.  I can do the basics of what I need to while on the go and if I need to do something serious I will sit down and pull out my laptop.  That is my preference though.All in all a great phone for a reasonable price.  I would highly recommend it to anyone either traveling or just looking for an unlocked phone in the U.S. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 23:38:09	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

50406539	Had this phone for a couple of days, and really like it.  Previously I was a user of the previous generation Windows Phone (7.5x) but wanted to switch to ATT; and this phone has so far been even better than the previous HTC HD7, which I also liked.  I like all the features I have tried so far, with the included Microsoft Phone 8 feature set, as well as some of the Nokia value added features such as Nokia Drive Turn by Turn navigation (Included for free!!), and the other features mentioned in the other reviews, etc. I really like the fact that you can pick what states GPS data you want to keep on the phone, so easy if you are navigating in a place that has no data signal, you can keep getting accurate directions, and its easy to add or delete other geographic areas when needed, or you can just add a whole country.  In previous phones I had to pay extra for voice turn by turn, but its included with the Nokia 920.For me the large screen, and size are perfect, and the weight mentioned by some reviews is no issue for me, but suggest that anybody contemplating purchase should try it.  The touch screen seems fast and responsive too.I was able to reinstall all of my Windows 7x applications with no issue and just by using my same Windows live ID, all of my setting seem to migrate with no issues encountered.The only real negative that I can think of, is that my Microsoft Zune PC software (and my collection of MP3s purchased over the years) is not as easily managed from my PC to this phone, because my desktop PC Zune software does not sync directly with the phone nor my playlists from within Zune desktop software (or I have not yet figured it out), but rather I have to use a different Microsoft Application within my main PC to Copy the music folders\mp3s to the phone.  I actually transferred the files over to the Nokia 920 very quickly, but it is not yet a smooth way to manage multiple music tastes within a family as was the direct syncing that Zune provided..........I am sure Microsoft will improve this, but it is the only negative I have seen so far.... 	jwilets	10-25-2015 23:39:36	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65085776	I have owned it for a few days now and here's what I like / don't like:it gets great reception, has a good battery, integrates well with other bluetooth devices, and overall works as expected.However, when I made the purchase, I bought three of them (for myself and family members) and two of them had bad sim cards. An easy and free fix but a bit of an annoyance.You should also be aware that the system memory is very low - like an unheard of 150mb.  All apps by default are placed in this memory and it fills up quick. You can manually move apps to the 1gb phone memory, but not all apps you download can be moved.  Increasing the size of the micro sd card has no effect on this limitation.I gave four stars because of this limitation, however if I had known I probably still would have made the purchase because of the price, size and weight. I like a compact phone that isn't too heavy yet still has all the features. 	jwilets	10-25-2015 23:46:18	Neutral	Other	Hardware	Other	Hardware	Internal Hardware	had to replace SIM cards	false

66991387	Unboxing, initial configuration and getting the device to run have been smooth.The wall charger is very impressive. Small round design with a USB to micro-USB cable. Going with the industry standards, is always appreciated. Connectivity  Charging is a no-hassle game.Setting up the Windows Live account - smooth.Setting up Gmail (this is my primary email  and I want all my Gmail folders to push sync with my phone like on the Droid) - 3 step instead of 1, but I again appreciate the way Microsoft/Nokia have this configuration.To setup Gmail to sync your contacts, calendar  inbox is easy - just choose the Gmail option in the add account screen, tap in the username  password and you are ready to roll.But to have all your folders push sync'd- choose Outlook in the add account screen- tap in the email address  password. tap in sign in.- it will fail and prompt for domain. tap in gmail.com.- it will fail again and prompt for server. tap in m.google.com.- this will create your account. Get into the account settings  change the download new content setting to as items arrive... and you are done.- Installing/setting up Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Kindle, Whatsapp, Tango, Netflix, Office, X-box live is a breeze. I love the Need for Speed games series running seamlessly on my phone.Apps----Do not be in haste to install all the apps you can find. Its true, there is a lot of crapware in the Windows Marketplace  I seriously hope that Microsoft mops up the mess. Using appropriate filtering like Top Free, Top paid, Featured will help. Also the App Highlights application details some notable apps. The Nokia apps are also well designed to work on this phone. The Nokia Creative Studio almost replaces Instagram. But as far as the camera is concerned, the auto-focus function need to be improvised. Surely a software/firmware update will fix it.I am not liking the Zune software to sync music or other content with my phone. I like to better manage using the file system than using a software (Zune) layer. I mean, the phone should show up on the computer (WindowsPC in my case) as a USB drive. But, I am sure to find a workaround soon, like bypassing the iTunes for my iPhone.I have been downloading, installing, configuring and messing around with this phone non-stop for over 6 hours now  the battery is still going strong. Too early to comment on the battery, but with Nokia's reputation I have no doubts of this one spicing up an entire day.Hats off to Microsoft  Nokia. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 23:56:16	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
23680717	I was switching from a samsung captivate to this phone. I had a terrible support experience with the samsung hardware and was hoping for a better experience overall with this phone. Unfortunately that was not to be.I like the overall look of the phone. Very attractive and also probably does not need a case as the black shell seems pretty robust. Also, on paper very impressive specs. However this looks to me like a very poor android implementation.In fact i now like the samsung captivate UI (gingerbread) much better than the HTC's jelly-bean based UI. Maybe its a personal choice, but some simple points to note: Samsung (as does apple) keeps all the app icons to a uniform size. The layout of the icons is very uniform. HTC appears extremely haphazard, not at all pleasing to the eye. The font on the HTC phone is also miserable. Comon, u have such a big screen, make use of it for the fonts. In spite of having such a big screen i have to strain myself a bit to read text anywhere in any context on this screen.I was initially happy that considering NVIDIA's reputation for heat, this phone did not heat up when i watched videos even for about an hour. However my happiness was shortlived with games. Within a few minutes of firing up the preinstalled game, the phone got very hot. Also, when i paired it via blutooth to my car's audio system, the phone got hot. And it got hotter AFTER i turned off bluetooth. And it stayed hotter even in my pocket after that. Another annoying thing is that if you play youtube with audio output thru bluetooth, there is a significant lag between the video and audio, about 4-5 seconds.Some of the fault is also from Android Jelly Bean. For all the hype about project butter and stuff, android manages to bring this quad-core 1.7Ghz phone to a crawl! Netflix just crawls on this latest and greatest OS from google. Specifically the netlflix app takes a long time to respond to touch inputs. The video playback itself is ok.Another problem is the phone size itself. It is not like i have small palms or such, but it is annoying to operate this phone with one hand (this is of course a common problem for all these big phones). I ended up dropping it a few times just while entering text.All in all, the poor font, the overheating problems didn't give me much confidence in this phone. I have since dumped this phone.Really i wish there was a phone with the same screen sizes as the previous gen (4-4.2inches) with the latest chipsets. I don't know why these manufacturers want to just go with bigger size. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 23:56:16	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

There is a large amount of bloatware on the device and on a regular basis we have had to delete messages and app info on a regular basis to ensure we can get messages. 	l3g4cy	10-25-2015 23:56:16	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

26251195	I overall like this device, which I switched to from iPhone 4. The bigger screen size seems a bit odd at first, but it grows on you fast, and pretty soon I couldn't imagine going back to the smaller iPhone 4 display.The processor and memory are pretty fast, no complaints there. I like the fact that it boasts a file system, so it's possible to save files and email them later on for example. It also has the ability to open, edit, and save MS Office files, which is great. Google Talk works nicely too, compared to iOS where third party for fee apps just don't seem to be able to cut it.On the downside, the speaker phone volume is lower than other mobile devices I've used. And battery life, while not bad, is not great; practically one has to charge it in full before stepping out of the house, and usually plug it back in first thing upon coming back. I read reviews saying the screen is fragile, but so far it's worked fine for me (have had it for a couple of weeks). 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 00:02:40	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64876078	Within the first six months of me owning this phone it showed significant technical problems that make this phone a bare to use. I am someone who takes care of their phones. My last smartphone lasted me over 2 years. I hate this current phone with a passion.It constantly freezes and automatically resets itself, especially WHEN I ANSWER PHONE CALLS. Is this how far we have gotten in technology? Our phones can send tweets to millions around the world but won't answer phone calls. Worst part, the makers of this phone have no idea how to fix this issue and many people have had the same problem. Factory reset does not fix the problem and it will force you to re-download all your apps.In addition, the touch screen quality is below par from phones such as an iphone. Sending texts can become a chore because you will click the wrong letters several times in one sentence.Here's my favorite brilliant design feature: a 5mp camera with NO AUTOFOCUS. I don't care if it was 5 megapixels or 555 megapixels. If my picture is out of focus, it is going to look blurry regardless of how many damn megapixels.This phone is obviously intended to be an affordable smartphone. However, I encourage everyone out there to spend the extra 50-100 dollars and buy a phone that is actually worth having.I want to note that I have no beef with android. I think android makes great software and is a great alternative to iphones. The Alcatel One Fierce is NOT that alternative.BUYERS YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 00:02:40	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Internal Hardware		false

64845596	Wow!  This is a BEAUTIFUL phone, kicks butt of flip version of Shine from Verizon.  Slider is sweet, phone feels solid.  AND boy DOES it SHINE!!.... in virtually most lighting.  Roll bar select key is a bit tricky at first but soon becomes very natural, AND you look so cool because of it!  Has basic goodies, SIM card very accessible and compatible, battery life better than average.  Standard MP3 player.  Has microSD expansion slot for up to 2GB.  Slight problems with reception outside of major metropolitan areas and some dead spots in small cities due to tri-band but overall pretty good (I use ATT/Cingular).  Tons of cool ringtones and sound effects.  Mirrored effect slightly difficult to read in strong sunlight.  USB connection to desktop worked effortlessly like direct plug flash drive.  Camera quite decent although some delay in trigger.  Has flash but only on/off - no auto.  2 megapixel photos are better than most.  Hottest slider around, no doubt.  I use this as my cool factor phone.  Highly recommend it!

22616196	This is a simple phone in that you can put phone numbers in and call people which is my major use for it.  It does a lot ofdifferent applications that as yet I am not fully knowledgeable about but also things that I don't need it for.  I was interested in a simple phone and that is why I ordered this one.  It is small (cute), easy to use for what my needs are and has a camera and a flashlight neither of which I have used yet.  It will play FM stations on it for a total of 4 hours though I have not used it for that long.  One of the best things about it is the length of time the battery lasts.  So far it has lasted for 2 weeks without recharging and I have talked on it for at least  2 and 1/2 or more hours and the battery does not show any use. It uses SIM cards to collect your stored information and has slots for 2 of them.

66597739	I bought two of these and they arrived in good time and well protected.  Install of both was as installs go and they worked the first time.  You could only detect the difference in quality from the original when looking at it from a deep angle - you could see the fluorescent glare from the back light.  This does not really affect the everyday function.  It will obviously be evident in video playback but should not be an issue if your viewing angle is not too acute.  One of the phones started dimming out after the install and I initially thought it was the screen until I swapped them and the problem recurred, implicating the phone itself.

67015253	The Samsung T301G is the one slider phone offered by Tracfone as I write this review. I bought it to replace Mrs. Spudman's T Mobile pay as you go phone. We have no problem with T Mobile, just that particular phone.The Samsung is a small, light, many featured phone for someone who doesn't need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive fancy phones. Mostly we just want to make and receive phone calls on the go without being burdened by a service contract with a monthly bill.Though she's a technophobe, Mrs. Spudman had little trouble setting up the phone and her voicemail account using the included instructions.  My own phone is an LG Tracfone model; I have been very happy with Tracfone and find it easy to add minutes and check my account either on the phone or on the Tracfone site.Likes:Easy set upThe display - clear, bright and easy to read. When placing or receiving a call, phone numbers appear on the screen in large digits. Love it!The ringer is loud and very audible. Choices of ring tones are limited and don't match those of the fancy phones, but they are more than adequate for our tastes. Additional ring tone choices are available on the Tracfone site for a fee. They're really nothing special though.Voice quality on this phone is excellent at both ends of the phone call. It's as good as our land line's and better than that of my LG phone.The external Caller ID. When your phone rings, the caller's number is displayed on the screen. The user can then choose to accept or not accept the call.Battery life has been more than acceptable for us. Mrs. Spudman turns off the phone's power overnight to make the charge last even longer. Charging is conveniently simple and doesn't take that long. You can charge the phone in your car or at home.I bought the phone's optional accessory package which includes a case, earphones, and two chargers and adapters. A great deal. The phone also came with some starter minutes and double minutes for life, a great, great feature.  At the time I ordered, I even got a ten dollar restaurant gift certificate.The phone was easy to hook up to our hands free Bluetooth  in our 2011Legacy.Dislikes -  NONE so far.Some of the features:Text messaging, voice mail, free caller ID, free call waitingBluetoothSlider designVGA camera with decent picturesColor screen displayMMS picture messaging - My wife and daughter exchange photos regularlyHandsfree speakerHearing Aid CompatibleDouble minutes for life - This is a deal maker.For the low price, features, and lack of any long term commitment, I don't think you can go wrong with this phone.

78984791	I just recently bought the Nokia Lumia 920 (in black) a little over a month ago. This is by far the best phone I have had so far. My first phone was a Nokia and I loved it and then I started trying out different phones all of which ended up being sub par (blackberry, android phones).The Best Things about this phone:1. The screen is magnificent! Everything is so clear. The biggest thing I noticed with this phone which has always been a hassle to me is that you can see it in the sun. NO GLARE! That alone is one reason for me to get it.2. The call quality is surpassed by none. Nokia has always had the best phones when it came to call quality and with it being an LTE phone it really doesn't get much better.3. The camera is great and everyone knows that already so I am not gonna talk much about it.4. It has a great sturdy body/shell, it fits so comfortably in my hand I don't have any problem with the weight or size. They also positioned the power button below the volume rocker which makes it so easy to reach when holding it in your hand.5. The Nokia pre-loaded Apps are amazing. The maps unlike Apple maps are phenomenal.6. And to be honest I am just a huge fan of live tiles. You get the customization of an Android phone but with the (in my opinion) better looking and sleeker live tiles. Which I feel look much better.7. Also because the phone is a matte type finish on the back it doesn't collect finger tips.Those are just the ones I could think of off the top of head.Now for the cons of the phone:There really aren't any truly negative cons.1. The only problem I have had is that the battery life sometimes does not last as long as I would like. On some days it will last the entire day but others it will last till late afternoon.2. A wider App selection would be nice. But that will come with time seeing how Windows 8 is so new. Don't get me wrong it has great Apps and all of the ones you would need but if you are into all the little 3rd party indie style apps on iphone or android don't get your hopes up.Other then that everything is great.I am a college student so I am constantly on my phone and so I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking to buy. I would definitely buy this phone again and lets be honest you can't beat the 99 dollar price tag and early adopters of the phone get the free charge pad where you just place your phone on it and it will start charging which is awesome because you don't have to plug in your phone anymore. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 00:20:37	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

Utterly useless in the dark.The processor is rather slow and interactions often get bogged down.The phone storage is very limited. There is a large amount of bloatware on the device and on a regular basis we have had to delete messages and app info on a regular basis to ensure we can get messages. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 00:22:36	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

65870250	Allows use of the best network - Verizon - the lowest cost for that particular network.  Battery life is good, call quality is good, available minutes displays on the phone.  Worked on an out of state school trip with no roaming charges.  Never drops calls in our area.  If the teenager who is using it loses the thing, the $25 cost will be much less trouble than more expensive phones.  Our average use level is probably 3-4 calls per week plus 4 or 5 texts per week, if that.  For much heavier use, the verizon pre-paid plan is probably not cost competitive.  For a $25, it was a great value for a basic communication device.  Will not call back up to the Enterprise to get beamed aboard when on foreign planets, but hey, it's $25, and costs us about $10 / month.  Verizon's website was tricky at first as it seemed to be hiding the lower cost options for pre-purchasing minutes.  Watch the time till expiration of the minutes, the minimum purchase expires in 30 days.  Availability of the less costly options seemed to be buried a bit on the website, which kept trying to direct me to more expensive phone plans.  Once set up the phone has been zero hassle.  Very pleased for the use described. Teenager is able to call or text but is uninterested in using it as a toy.  And that's what I'm talking about. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 00:26:04	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
64947090	Nice bells and whistles--camera, voice recorder, expandable memory (only to 8gb)for downloads and pictures, bluetooth, etc but really disappointed with phone function. It locks at every turn and is slow to unlock. Need to use a code number? The time it takes to unlock the dialpad may not let the code be fully read and lead to rejection or disconnection. Removing ALL security lock helped some but who wants less security?It does make a nice PDA/Alarm clock (I do like the optional hourly tone!)/calendar/memo/etc so kept the phone as emergency back up since the reception bars have always been good BUT would not choose this model for telephone use. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 00:26:04	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

79389940	Everything nice everyone has said is true. I don't feel that is enough when the phone is so outrageously big and heavy. My 1 star is simply because it's borderline unusable as a daily phone.Using the phone is an unpleasant experience. It's bulky and overweight. It doesn't fit in my cupholder, it doesn't fit in my Dockers. I have to wear a belt with my jeans when it is in my pocket.I do not have sausage fingers or poor vision. Any advantage of a phone this large is completely lost on me.The very first thing anyone who borrows my phone says is Wow, it's heavy.If you are concerned about the size, you might be better off waiting a couple of months when the new phones come out. The Lumia 920 might be the best Windows 8 phone now, but it certainly won't be the best Windows 8 phone released this year.*update*I've returned the phone and gone back to my Focus. I'll wait until later this year when a more usable device is released.There are plenty of other small issues both with the phone and with WP8. WP8 introduced a lot of really good features but also ignored or introduced others. The front button lights don't time out and there is still no quick way to toggle vibrate mode, for example. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 01:18:22	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Enclosure		false
64894499	*** UPDATE! I never got internet to work properly. I never was able to send or receive MMS even though I changed the APN as was stated. ALSO, now I am NOT able to call anybody or receive a call. I do not get any service on one side of town (still inside city limits). I was so excited about this phone but after two weeks it is pretty much useless. My bf wanted to buy the same phone but I advised against it. I am waiting to hear back from the seller.I got this phone alot sooner than it was estimated at. I loved it when I saw it. It is huge, twice the size of my galaxy(regular). The screen is rather crisp and clear. It came with the two batteries (neither were charged), a USB charger, and a wall charger. The wall charger is USELESS in the states. It is a foreign charger with two large round prongs instead of the two flat prongs.It was easy to switch over to English although a thing pops up everytime I type asking me what language I want. That is really annoying. Also it highlights everything I type as mispelled when I know its not. (ex. sent text of hope you get this to bf and it listed all words as wrong). The internet is sssssooooooo slow. I have spent two days trying to download hotmail's app. Still nothing. The battery drains very quickly, but I have been trying to get an app so that part is questionable. The camera is definitely lacking quality. Its not terrible though. I do like that it has the rear and front facing camera. It also has a panaramic (sp?) feature which I like.The first thing I messed with on the phone was the Flashlight feature/app. I love it. My 3y/o goes crazy when I turn it on and off. The radio doesn't work unless you use the earphones that come with it as they have an antennae built in. I was able to get 2 analog tv channels (both religious)on the tv. Alot of people weren't able to use the tv. I doubt I will use it but its neat to know its there. It took me a day or so to realize there was an antennae for the tv in the bottom of the phone. I thought it was a stylus until I pulled it out. It is VERY fragile.I have a sim for Straight Talk in the phone. It shows T-Mobile as my carrier even though I changed the APN to StraightTalk (that was the EASIEST APN change I have ever dealt with!!!). I don't know how to fix it and am not sure if it's something I did or because of the SIM or what. I'm going to call the company when I finish this.So all-in-all my only issue is the incrediably slow internet speed. Somebody else posted about it on the page of another seller of this phone. She said she had to call t-mobile to get directions for turning on something regaurding the internet. She said that once she did that the internet speed picked up. So hopefully ST will be able to help out on that. My old samsung galaxy was constantly overheating and freezing up. The only way to fix it was to take the battery out. That started happening the first day I got it. I have had this one for 2 days now and have not had any type of issue like that. Fingers crossed.**if anybody can give me some hints/help with this phone please leave me a comment. rudeness will be reported. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 01:18:22	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		false

64307755	Everything seems to function most times but this phone glitches out more than any phone I remember(and I haven't taken it swimming yet). The wifi is nice, doesn't charge minutes. I think it charges minutes by data used for web, so email is ok but pictures and adds or buttons or logins eat time. The fact that everything works  is why i gave it as a high score. To pocket dial emergency it just has to type 000 and send even with the keypad locked, and its somehow easy to do. I must have called 911 20 times from my pocket. I went from carring in an empty pocket to changing pockets to not carrying it. That is unacceptable for me so I have to buy a new phone.So close to a just under great phone, and the 911 issue. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 01:28:05	Complaint		Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Enclosure		false

This no-frills phone is perfect for that and works as advertised.  I did a lot of research on pay-as-you-go cell phone service, and Tracfone seems to offer the best solution for my needs.  Service available when needed, but the phone is used very, very seldomly, so monthly service is a waste of money.  It's very affordable to keep active minutes for it - about $20 every 3 months for 60 minutes (and the minutes gets doubled because of the double minutes for life card included with the phone) if purchased online on the Tracfone website.

65882641	I bought this treo after my phone and PDA died almost simultaneously. I had avoided a treo mainly due to the smaller screen compared to my Palm Tungsten but needed a device with a keyboard and wasn't interested in RIM products.I initially bought an iPhone but gave it to my wife due to  1. Poor phone functionality 2. Crippled sms (message forwarding, MMS, file attachment; Apple?) , crippled Bluetooth and lack of a hard keyboard.I was initially wary of buying  a windows mobile device due to prior poor experience with pocket pc software. I have been pleasantly surprised by this device.1. Speed-very fast overall, the only slowdowns I experience is with notes for some reason. I've accumulated 100's of them over the yrs but this is no excuse as my 7 yr old palm could speed through them2. Call quality is crystal clear much better than the iPhone's in my area.3. Bluetooth-this phone is compatible with Audi's car kit and the voice quality is stellar. Palm's site states it does not download contacts to the car but it did download some of them in my case. All the BT protocols of a 21st century device are supported unlike the iPhone's 20th century implementation.4. Proper GPs-not that iphone wannabe gps. Quick signal locks and 1 month free trial of TeleNav turn-by-turn is nice. I've heard TomTom's software works pretty well with this device.5.Battery life is so so, with email downloading in the background it will last about 2 business days. With a lot of websurfing it will barely last the day. I would say it's better than the iphone, not by much though.6. Touchscreen-finger friendly, I only use my stylus to write ink notes or use Epocrates.WM 6.1 although it looks ugly compared to the iPhone OS, is a true multitasking OS, actually feels like a portable computer. I can wait for a satellite lock loading, go to another program and return  back to the GPS as it finishes.7. Form factor- love the size,  overall dimensions are nice and its quite thin, great job on the design. Keyboard key material is fine for me a Treo newbie.Overall this phone is a keeper, the combination of hard keyboard and touchscreen is great, while the addition of some apps (SPB, skyfire, kinomaplay to name a few) make it a truly superb device. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 01:35:55	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66849984	So I bought this phone more than a year ago as a present for my boyfriend. All was great, until I got the same phone, but directly from google. My phone updated nicely to jelly bean while this one didn't. So I finally decided to contact samsung about it, and it seems that this kind of phones do not get updates from Samsung yet. But this phone got notifications about a system update, so after some research I downloaded an app that told me that the phone has  a yakjuxe ROM, which seems to be a custom one and can't be updated (or at least those were the complaints on different forums). Now I have to find a good guide that tells me how to update to a google updatable ROM and hope I don't brick it. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 01:42:11	Complaint	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66298090	I have had this phone for about a month now, and i can say it was a huge disappointment! I bought this phone through Dell and only paid about $270.00, so at the time i thought i was getting a really sweet deal,I should have taken the youtube reviews more serious...I will start with some of the good things first.The design is very nice and professional, things are kinda compact in size, but for what it attempts to do, is built into a very slim package. the phone also feels very high quality and lite.phone calls and speaker were always superb.The camera is neat! it takes very nice pictures, records video, and can even do panoramic pics.The battery life is extremely good for a smart phone.here is where things come crashing down...first, there is no off button, serious. you can turn off the screen, turn off wifi, BT, but you can NOT shut off the phone without taking out the battery, so if some app gets stuck or you need to reset to your network, you will have to take the thing apart to accomplish this. dont believe me? google PALM's answer for not including an off button.second, the wifi support is lousy, I would establish a link to my home wifi and my work wifi connections, only to have to reset them every other week because the phone would forget to use them as default.the media player on it sucks! it will play video, mp3. BUT, i found that trying to listen to music on it, tracks would constantly stutter. and forget about using the stereo bluetooth. I had a really difficult time trying to figure out if the stuttering was caused by the headset or the phone only to discover, for some reason, if you shut off the screen while media player is going, tracks will start stuttering, which basically meant, i had to leave it pluggged in with the screen on to listen to music...the final issue i had, was with email. I would go through the process of setting up a pop email account ('gmail', 'work'). things would look good for a couple of days, or even a week, and then all of a sudden I would get error messages indicating 'sent messages could not be sent' or something similar. the email accounts would completely stop working, and the only way to alleviate the issue i could come across was to delete the accounts on the phone and go through the whole process of setting up the accounts all over again.i'm pretty sure a lot of these issues are caused by the fact that it uses 'win mobile'. that seems to be the popular answer. but i would have liked things to have been tested and worked right out of the box. and not have to be a network admin to set up basic wifi... 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 01:44:03	Neutral	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Display		false
66631407	I've had the ZTE Warp Sequent through Boost Mobile for about five months. It's broken irreparably twice.The phone has generally performed very well. I've installed and run a variety of apps, all with very reasonable performance. There's plenty of storage for software and data, and the Warp Sequent has been very responsive. I don't stream a lot of video or run any computation-intensive apps, so I can't speak to high-end performance, but for everyday talking, texting, and surfing, the Warp Sequent gets the job done.Call quality and WiFi connectivity have both been very stable. The battery lasts about a day with an average amount of usage. I've never had to charge it except overnight.On the other hand, when the Warp Sequent fails, it fails spectacularly. Mine lasted only 34 days before it began shutting down constantly -- and I do mean constantly. Even dialing half of a number on the newly-restarted phone was enough to make it restart again. I had to send the device back to ZTE for repair.Here, ZTE makes clear why this phone is cheaper than its competitors. Getting a replacement took about 2.5 weeks, end to end, including time for several phone and e-mail exchanges with ZTE. The customer must also pay the shipping cost to get the phone to their repair center (though ZTE pays for the return trip).That's a long time without a phone. Boost Mobile will send a loaner phone if you call to request one, but even that takes several days to arrive, and then it's the cheapest flip phone available.I've been entirely pleased with the Warp Sequent's performance, features, usability, and stability while it was working. But now that it's broken for a second time, I will be purchasing something from a different manufacturer to replace it. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 01:44:03	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	Replacement	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

This phone is fun to use, easy to use, sturdy, great display, great call quality. I feel like my life is much easier and organized now.UPDATE: Still really liking this phone, but there are some problems. When I put it on speaker, it's not loud enough. It also doesn't ring loud enough. The battery runs out really quickly, but this is my first smart phone, so this is something I'm not used to.

66310914	Ordered 8/31/2013 via Moto-maker.  Received a phone call two days later stating I should call them to clear up an activation issue.  When I called, representatives could not figure out what was wrong with the order and kept transferring me to different departments.  After two days of phone calls that they initiated one rep finally seemed to resolve the issue.  Then as the est delivery date approached, I noticed my phone was still not shipped.  I called to make sure everything was ok with order.  Rep changed the shipment date three times after I questioned him on his promised delivery days... I do no think the reps are well trained.  They have generally been unhelpful.  They are pleasant to the point of being annoying; constantly marketing scripts about how Motorola wants to make sure customers have a great experience.I tried to cancel the order but they would not allow me to cancel so close to shipment date...wow what an annoying experience!Hopefully will receive phone sometime in the near future and be able to amend the rating after finding the amazing utility this phone potentially has!Addendum 9/7/2013A pleasant surprise.  I received the phone today 9/7/2103 (initially ordered 8/31/2013).  Not too bad.  Rep on phone claimed that deliveries were not made on Saturdays.  I guess they were wrong about something else again.  I am happy to have received the phone in a timely manner despite the customer service frustrations.  I am amending my initial rating and will update rating after using the phone for a while.Addendum 9/10/2013After using phone for a few days it is pretty much everything I expected.  Very good feeling phone.  Takes a little getting used to the smaller the screen but nice to have a smaller form factor again (I am coming from a note 2 and have previously owned an iphone4, incredible 2, evo4g, blackberry bold, iphone 3gs).  The always on/hands free functions work well and is one of the things that puts this phone above all the others.  Below is a summary of my thoughts.Pros:1. Customizatble: Motomaker website is nice and allows personalization that is not available anywhere else.  Good choices and it is fun making a personal phone!2. Form factor: 4.7 inches is a great form factor for me.  I do not watch a ton of videos and do not play a ton of games.  I mostly do emails, text, read news, and use apps like maps, epocrates etc.  I play games once in a while and do watch some videos but this is a perfect size for me.  I like the portability of the phone and the shape  weight.  It feels great.  In fact I would say it is the best feeling phone I have ever used in terms of holding and carrying it.3. Battery Life:  Excellent.  Gets me through a day of use in a small form factor.  Nicely done.4. Processor: Good enough.  Gets choppy when I use lots of apps serially but I expect that.  Only time will tell if the processors are good enough to future proof this phone.  But I think it will hold up pretty well.5. Software:  Motorola really has done something very different and practical with their version of android here.  Handsfree works well for me.  I especially appreciate it when I am driving.  But I actually find myself using it more than I thought I would.  I even use it sometimes when I am just sitting around.  The skin is light which I really like also.  Camera gesture is awesome and I have found myself using the camera more these past few days.  If this keeps up this phone is worth it just for these reasons...I use the functions on the phone more!  If I take more pics and use the functions of the phone more then that pretty much makes the case for me to buy this phone vs others just on that fact alone.  Notifications are also second to none.  I can see messages pending to be read without having to touch any buttons when I pick the phone up.  Something as simple as that is a great feature.6. Voice phone calls clear and signal strength good.Cons:1. For me Moto maker is one of the factors that make this phone distinctive.  So although personalization is a pro the service failed horribly because of the customer service.  I almost did not get the phone because of the moto maker experience.  Actually I was almost not able to get the phone because of the customer service...After ordering the phone, waiting about a week to get it, going through torture during that week to make sure I got it, and then using it for about 4 days, I have to say I would recommend this phone.  Great feeling and looking phone while being very functional.  Minus one star for horrible moto maker experience because of customer service. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 01:53:59	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
64538198	Phone was free with a new two yr Verizon contract -- purchased at Best Buy.  Both companies should be ashamed.  Within first 60 days, returned phone twice due to very poor sound quality, poor reception, and many keyboard keys didn't work.  After 30 days, to include a $7/month maintenance plan, Best Buy tells me after third swap that I have no recourse -- they will only repair the phone, which so far fails to remedy the many, many problems with this phone.  The only reason to give two stars is the Qwerty slide-out keyboard which has nice spacing and nice key touch. Btw, the Samsung WiFi modem purchased has also been troublesome.While I may be stuck with Verizon for another 23-months, it is the last purchase from Verizon and Best Buy I will ever make.  TMobile was a much better service provider (but not according to Consumer Reports ratings), and I had a very reliable 2-yr phone purchased from one of the TMobile stores. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 01:53:59	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Internal Hardware		false

I would recommend the sidekick data plan because without it the phone isn't very fun (I don't have the data plan).The problems I had with the phone was that it's a little too big which is inconvenient at times, there's no touchscreen, and you can't customize the main screen with personal photos only the themes they give you. The phone is also a little outdated, it's a 2009 model so guaranteed it's going to be a little old. In a world where smartphones dominate, this sidekick has no touch screen and is not thin and small enough to fit in a pocket. It's a little bulky. I wish I would've looked into the size of the phone first.For the price, this is an awesome phone but if you want a phone that will last a long time I suggest a newer phone or model.No problems otherwise with the phone itself, calls are fine and quality is good. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 01:55:47	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64335591	Let me preface my comments by stating that I'm a huge fan of most all of Samsung's products. I've owned several Samsung phones of the past several years and have always been very pleased.I purchased this phone for use on Verizon's network. All previous Samsung products have been on T-mobile. I'm not sure if my problems are Samsung related, Verizon related or a combination of the two but something is bad wrong. About 40% of the calls can not be heard by people who I call or who call me. I can always hear them but it's completely hit or miss with them hearing me.Concerning the responsiveness I will say that the S2 from T-mobile was much more responsive than the S3 on Verizon although the specs for the S3 are far superior. Data is great and speeds are incredibly fast.I've seen multiple review all over the internet with this issue but Verizon is insistent that there are no known issues. They are being accommodating with return/exchange within their 14 day policy. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 01:59:04	Comparison	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

All they could do was offer a discount on a replacement charger. I did try to charge the phone when I got back to the US but it still wouldn't but this time it said the battery was not a Sony Ericsson battery which it was clearly stated on the battery when i looked at it. So i won't buy a phone from Amazon or BytesOfDeals again. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 01:59:04	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
64043749	As another reviewer stated, it's a poor mans smart phone. While it isn't that smart, it will get the job done. The best thing I can say about this phone is the triple minutes for life.  LG uses a proprietary software, so you can find apps for it, but not as many as you'll find for phones with other operating systems. The phones screen is not as responsive as other touch screen phones and it lacks some of the amenities that other pay-as-you-go phones have such as a dedicated email client. Having gone through 3 of these phones, I can tell you that for whatever reason, it's going to freeze and reboot at some point, hopefully while you're not in the middle of something important.If I had it to do over again, I would seriously look at the Motorola EX124g. It seems to have everything that LG forgot to do with the 800G, such as a dedicated email client, a 3MP camera as opposed to a 2MP, a more responsive touch screen, an included stylus and support for an 8GB memory card as opposed to the LG's 4GB. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 01:59:04	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false
5800623	Awesome machine. However it's usability as a phone is limited. Blue tooth connects but in call voice quality blows chunks. Cannot hear the other person and make out only 3 or 4 words out of five.Battery could last a little longer.On the whole it's great. Hoping HTC fixes the blown out blue tooth in call quality but don't see it happening. I do read that rooting and installing other operating type stuff fixes this.Software update! Bluetooth call quality fixed! Solid 4.5 stars now, wish battery had more juice is only prob now 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:02:58	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
69261705	I LOVE this device.Others have talked about the device, so I figure I'll provide some tips to new Lumia users (cool things I found):Apps - going to sound like a Nokia commercial, but these are the ones I use most:* Smartshoot - takes several photos in succession and lets you EASILY pick / choose the best bits of each to make one good photo* Cinemagraph - Take a short video and animate certain pieces of it while leaving the other parts still (youtube it)* Nokia Music - Free and ad-free, new music with offline access (no data charges). This must cost Nokia money, but who care, I paid for the phone* Nokia Drive+ - Free turn by turn voice guided GPS that uses the same maps as Garmin* Metrotube - Awesome Youtube app* Photobeamer - send a photo from your screen to any web enabled device - mindbendingly simple and one of those apps that you can't understand how it's not 'magic'Visual and music search - just hit the search button and then choose the eye - you can scan QR codes, bar codes, Microsoft tags etc. without an app. If you hit the 'musical note' icon, it will listen to a song and tell you the name, again, no app requiredKids corner - allow your kids to bypass the lock on your phone but only get to their apps.Wireless charging - this is more awesome than you can imagine if you haven't used it.Skydrive - works like iCloud but is available on Android, Xbox, iphone and Windows 7 and 8. Take a pic or video, and it will automatically be on your PC, Xbox or other device. Upload an office doc to Skydrive and edit it on the web or your phone. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:02:58	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
64218091	I've been in use of this device for about 16 days now.  I gave this magnificent smartphone 4 stars instead of 5 because of the internal storage deception.  To some people it may not be a big deal considering their implementation of MotoCast (I'll come back to that).  When I researched the specs, it was advertised to have had 16GB of internal storage not including the micro-sd expansion capabilities.  However, I got the phone and hooked it up to my MacBook Pro it stated only 8GB of internal storage.  Not a deal breaker but I would have thought something like this would have been stated in a review of some kind.  The Andoid system  OS takes up that much space lol?  Ok, whatever.I previously primarily used the Nokia N8.  The hardware is great in my opinion but the Symbian OS simply can't compare to any Apple or Android OS.  There's a reason Nokia joined with Windows.  After having the Motorola Xoom for several months I  became greatly impressed by the OS.  I figured I would check out what I've been missing in terms of smartphone OSs and purchase my first Android driven smartphone.  The user interface is pretty easy to get accustomed to.  If loading your device with apps is your thing then Market has more than enough.  I've found a ton of useless applications but my fair share of relevant apps.The physical appearance of the Droid Razr is definitely a conversation starter.  Even the iphone fanboys can't help but ask about it.  I've yet to actually take it apart to see how easily the battery can be accessed but that may come in a later review (who knows).  The screen resolution is superb in my opinion.  If I recall correctly the Nokia N8 has a 3.5 screen.  The difference between that and the Droid Razr is more than noticeable.  I've gotten use to the size difference.  I've read reviews about this device being difficult to manipulate with one hand.  I haven't really had this problem.  My hands aren't really all that big but I can hold it single-handedly with no problem.I'm still patiently waiting for an Android version of VLC player.  I'm utilizing MX video player on both the Xoom and Razr.  They work great with avi files but still has a problem with mkv files.  I'm sure I'll continue to have this problem as long as VLC for Android is in production.  MotoCast is pretty cool.  The setup is painless believe it or not.  The streaming capabilities are pretty nice in my opinion.  This program is definitely resourceful.The Nokia N8 has a pretty nice camera.  The camera on the Droid Razr isn't as nice but the difference isn't that noticeable.  I did manage to try out the HD video recording.  Let's just say it works well enough.  I mean, I would be pretty disappointed if it was subpar considering the price you pay for this smartphone.Overall, I'm pretty satisfied.  The design and physical appearance are great.  The OS is definitely an upgrade over what I've been use to (and this isn't even the infamous ICS that it's supposed to receive).  Would I recommend this device?  I sure would.  I also recommend you do your research; perhaps on the Droid 4.0, Galaxy Nexus, Note, and iPhone.  Then take your pick.  At the end of the day you have to ask yourself how much you plan on using this smartphone. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:02:58	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65563386	Not a bad phone for the price. It comes with Android 4.1.1. here's my 2 cents about this phone.The Good: light weight, decent battery life. bright screen. MicroSD 32GB support, 480p resolution screen is clear.The Bad: Only has about 512MB of system ram so you must make sure you don't have too many things running in the background. You must remove battery before you can remove/insert MicroSD Card. Will not play back 720p Videos.Other: The Prism II seems to have a CPU that's about 15%-20% weaker than my Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant.Issue 1: When I'm listening to Music on the phone using standard headphones,  a call comes in, I have to disconnect the headphones to take the call because the phone thinks the headphones have a mic. I can hear the caller on the headphones, but the caller can't hear me. They really need to fix that. can't find any option to use the phones Mic while using Headphones during a call like I can with my Galaxy S2.Issue 2: When listening to Music, the phone on occasionally enters Voice Dialing mode. I installed WinAmp  the problem got better,  now only happens very rarely. Seems like there is an issue with the phone or it's software. I have contacted Huawei  informed them about this issue, hoping they can tell me whats causing it.Conclusion: This is the kinda phone you give to someone who's just getting their first Android Phone, or one you give to the Kids. Not for Power Users due to weak CPU, Lack of TV Output, or Low Resolution Screen. Plays Angry Birds just fine! You will have a great time on the s***ter!2 Stars removed.  1 for the Headphone Issue, 1 for the Voice Dialing issue. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:05:16	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false
58677857	Back screen crack within 3 weeks, no drop! Defective product!  Terrible Service!I stil cannot believe why some people choose not helpful for the review of unreasonable back crack. It's the truth. Only what I can believe is either Nexus/GOOGLE fun or GOOGLE/LG hire somebody to click no for it.A week ago I see a crack on the back of the screen. It's only 3 weeks after I received the product.I used the phone for 3 weeks with no drop on the floor. I'm a kind of person always taking care of my personal stuff so well. So I believe the phone is under my control.Then I did some research and find a lot of similar problems happened. There has been some conclusion that it is caused by temperature. So technically, it should be a design problem, which I believe that it is defective product issue.Then I contact GOOGLE and learn 2 things:1. Google only has 15 days policy to return the product.2. Google will charge 15% restocking fee if we return the product.What a big company! What a terrible return service policy they have! Especially comparing Amazon!Then I told them the problem about the crack, they said they are not responsible for the damage, I should contact LG for repair.After I contact LG, the customer service is terrible. The first one said they don't have this kind of problem, and he said that it is physical damage and not apply to the warranty, and need me to send it to LG to do examination, and need two weeks to get the phone.1. I need to pay the shipping fee.2. Wait for 2 weeks.3. Probably I need to pay repair fee because they have made decision that it doesn't apply to the warranty.4. I told him about the defective problem caused by temperature, he told me he's never heard about that and all customers called about the cracks are because they drop the phone. The truth is I've never dropped the phone after I got it, and there has been some news can be searched online by GOOGLE! How happened it has been in some news!Conclusion:1. Terrible services by two big companies throw the ball with each other. The customers are the loser finally.2. I still believe the CSR in LG is lying.3. I won't believe Google can do anything anymore. I probably like CSR in LG better because they are straight, not like Google's CSR, kindly saying a lot of words, but no help.4. Terrible Google return policy. 15 days return with 15% restocking fee. Do you want to extend your retail business as an small ebay seller?DON `T RECOMMEND google Nexus or LG phone.If nothing happened, it's functional. If something happened, you will see their terrible policy and service.See the link below for more related case.[...] 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:05:16	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

66536273	-I have been a SprintPCS customer for 5 years. Just like many other Sprint customers, I felt Sprint's coverage is poor but the fact that I enrolled early gave me a very good plan. Therefore, what I did in the past 5 years was to consistently scanning for good phones to tackle the poor signal coverage in the area I live.I've been through Qualcomm QCP-2760, Samsung 8500, Sanyo 4900 and now Samsung VI660. The old Qualcomm had a decent reception in its days but couldn't compare with Samsung 8500. The 8500 was a legendary phone that was solidly designed and built. However, there's more to be desired in terms of its reception. After an extensive research, I bought my wife a Sanyo 4900 when she started her plan. I found its battery life and reception was very good but Sanyo 4900's downside was its bulky design and clumsy menu.Due to the consistent drop of calls when using Samsung 8500 at home, I was in the market again hunting for the next generation of cell phones that are reasonably priced but have the best reception. Sanyo has been regularly regarded as having excellent reception and battery life, which I could surely testify due to my ownership of the 4900. But I have to say I'm kind of fond of Samsung and its design due to my good experience with the 8500.The past couple years marked a down period for Samsung though. After 8500, Samsung released many new phones that were viewed as having miserable reception. However, most recently, it seemed like things have changed. VI660 and VGA1000 received new chips and many good reviews come in from their users.After comparing price and features, I opted for the VI660. I couldn't be happier with its name dial capability. It doesn't need any training and can recognize names very accurately. It certainly makes your driving much safer, too. If you use Samsung's earphone, all you need to do to dial a number is all talk, after you press a button on the earphone cord to intiate the name dial procedures. The maneuver within its menu is very intuitive and the battery life is decent. In addition, VI660 was among the limited number of phones that support SMS. Even though I don't use it that often, it's still a nice feature to have. Maybe I'm not really picky about battery life but recharging once every two days with many phone calls and some web usage doesn't sound too bad to me.However, the reception of Samsung VI660 is still not to my expectation. It is certainly better than the 8500 and offers a more unbroken conversation but I still suffer from dropping call which is less likely to happen to the Sanyo 4900. After so many attempts in keeping my plan by buying new phones, I am considering switching to Verizon even with the nice SprintPCS plan that I currently have. But if you are not living in an area that has poor signal coverage and you don't need a camera or external display, VI660 is truly an economic, feature packed and compact phone for you to have. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:07:06	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64795658	This is my very first smartphone, and the first Android device I've ever used. It is great, but I do have a few complaints, mostly with regards to the software.Hardware:The device is somewhat bulky, not the nicest looking phone I've ever seen. But the screen is fairly nice, especially considering that it isn't HD. My only real complaint here is that it isn't wide enough for my liking. Camcorder quality is good for an SD camera. The still photo quality is OK in good light, but in darker conditions the pictures come out grainy. It's a phone camera, though...something like this is to be expected. As for the Droid's most important feature, the keyboard, it is a little stiff and awkward to use, but not terrible. Definitely good enough for those who need it. Quick note: I'm not one of those people who requires a physical phone keyboard, so this wasn't a huge deal to me. Battery life is OK, just so long as Advanced Task Killer is open.Software:Android is, undoubtedly, a nice OS, much more flexible than iOS in terms of features (widgets, flash support, screen customization...none of that is on iOS. I have an iPod touch, so I know.). And the Google Play Store has grown so much, I can find just as many good apps there as I can in the Apple App Store. As of 10/31/12, the number of Android apps is now equal to the number of Apple apps - about 700,000. But with the latest update, connecting to Wi-Fi takes a much longer time than I would like. Also, my phone can be sluggish and the battery life is so bad now that I had to order an extended battery.Phone stuff:Call quality is fantastic and reliable. I am a former T-Mobile customer who switched to Verizon last year, so of course I was in for a pleasant surprise in terms of coverage. My family has a vacation house located in an area that is covered by no carriers other than Verizon, making my family's switch especially beneficial. Only downside is that Verizon is ridiculously expensive and the 3G network can be quite slow.All in all, a good phone at first, mediocre now. Be aware that it might freeze occasionally, especially in the midst of running an app like Google Maps. Luckily the battery is removable. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:07:06	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	Hardware	No Defect		false

It says that the display uses 75% of my battery - I really don't understand why.  I also don't really notice a difference between 4g and 3g, nevermind that you're supposed to use WIFI to save battery life. I also really hate the keyboard, to the point that I dread texting.

65882661	Bought this phone for my son and have used it extensively while ahem testing it for him. We've both used webOS for the last two years. I've most recently used the HP Pre 3 and use iOS  quite often due to another family member owning an iphone 4.Here are my thoughts:The budget for his replacement phone was $100 and I told him to review ATT's website for an appropriate smartphone. I'd already researched this and found the Lumia 920 to be the best value for money. His investigation landed him between the 920 and the iphone 4s which would be decided by a visit to an ATT store. Our initial impression was that it was rather heavy and large but he was able to fit it into his jeans pocket without much difficulty. Other than siri he found the 4s to be underwhelming and was quite impressed with his initial experience with windows phone 8 and ordered a black one.My impressions are the 920 is an impressive piece of hardware, yes it's heavy but it's also rock solid and doesn't need a case. I personally hate cases and have carried all my phones naked for the last several years which is nearly impossible with an iphone. If you add an otterbox case to an iphone it'll weigh almost the same as a 920. As another reviewer stated if you've had your present phone for more than a year the 920 won't be much heavier. This is a decent tradeoff for wireless charging and NFC in my opinion. Once you go wireless charging you'll never go back and is one of main the reasons I stuck with webOS phones for this long.The phone personally handles well because all buttons are within easy reach.  However if not positioned optimally the edges of the phone may dig into your palms but this is probably dependent on your hand's size. I love the camera button that allows a quick shot without unlocking the phone first.Windows phone 8 is slick and modern compared to iOS's antiquated OS.  iOS has slick apps but the OS itself is clunky. You need apps to do everything in iOS while a lot of functionality is already integrated into Win 8.One brilliant feature is family group where members can privately share a to do list, pictures, calendar and more. Skype is also fully integrated and social media profiles are linked similar to webOS's implementation. Kid's Corner is also an excellently thought out idea.Of course if you're an app junky win 8 may not be for you right now but that'll change in the next few months as the OS was only released to developers a few weeks ago.The only other windows phone in this price range presently is the HTC 8x but the $100 version only has 8Gb of ram (vs 32 gb in the 920) and lacks Nokia's killer apps like Nokia Drive, city lens, ESPN etc.There aren't any comparable Android Phones at this price point as I would only consider 4.2 and above as having comparable stability and fluidity. The Nexus 4 is nice but costs $299 plus it's wireless charging pad costs extra while it's presently free with the 920.Overall the Nokia Lumia 920 is`highly recommended and is the best smartphone for a $100. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:10:47	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	Software		false

64083012	Warning: this 2008 version of the Sidekick is no longer compatible with current TMobile services as of March, 2012!!  Incoming calls and caller ID's worked, but texting (sound notifications and contact names) services did not work for us.  After a couple of hours in our local TMobile store, we were informed that the manufacturer of this phone acknowledged a problem with these exact areas with this version of their phone, and there is NO remedy for this problem.  I am attempting to return this phone to Amazon ASAP. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:14:09	Complaint	No Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false
64343920	This is a guy's phone, not too big to fit in your pants pocket like the Galaxy S III and S 4. Very easy transition from my old Galaxy S Captivate. Good feel in the hand, with just enough grip from the rubberized case. Sound is great. I love having an actual button for Return at the bottom, as well as Home and Menu, the #34;soft#34; buttons on the Captivate often left me wondering if I actually tapped it or not, since response was sometimes slow. Great battery performance so far. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:14:09	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
65870250	Allows use of the best network - Verizon - the lowest cost for that particular network.  Battery life is good, call quality is good, available minutes displays on the phone.  Worked on an out of state school trip with no roaming charges.  Never drops calls in our area.  If the teenager who is using it loses the thing, the $25 cost will be much less trouble than more expensive phones.  Our average use level is probably 3-4 calls per week plus 4 or 5 texts per week, if that.  For much heavier use, the verizon pre-paid plan is probably not cost competitive.  For a $25, it was a great value for a basic communication device.  Will not call back up to the Enterprise to get beamed aboard when on foreign planets, but hey, it's $25, and costs us about $10 / month.  Verizon's website was tricky at first as it seemed to be hiding the lower cost options for pre-purchasing minutes.  Watch the time till expiration of the minutes, the minimum purchase expires in 30 days.  Availability of the less costly options seemed to be buried a bit on the website, which kept trying to direct me to more expensive phone plans.  Once set up the phone has been zero hassle.  Very pleased for the use described. Teenager is able to call or text but is uninterested in using it as a toy.  And that's what I'm talking about. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:14:09	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

If your like me and need a phone for a minimum of three years, you cant miss with this phone. I am not looking for a new phone every other year, I will be holding onto this for a while. The price of $49.00-$99.00, is a steal. I even dropped this phone in the bathroom face down, picked it up and kept on rolling. Remember what also makes this phone remarkable is the apps. I am now using the phone for less calls and more news streaming, YouTube and Netflix. The battery is excellent. Imagine using all the heavy battery usages and by the end of the day, you have juice and all it needs is a simple nighttime recharge. Camera looks like your looking through clear glass, need i say anymore!

64180354	I was a bit skeptical about Windows Phone (WP). I had a Blackberry Torch and Bold before that. I was tired of the phone freezing because the processor and/or RAM wasn't enough. I mainly use my phone for emails, texting, and calling UNTIL I got a WP.I originally looked at Android phones because all my friends just moved to them. I found out later that they crashed nonstop for them even though they were top of the line 4G LTE phones. I also found out that they charged their phones at least twice a day. I said no thank you to either. I eventually read reviews that said WP gives you the Android hardware with a much more fluid and stable OS.Fluid and Responsive: The OS runs smoothly from screen to screen. Check out #smokedbywindowsphone or on youtube the Windows Phone $100 Challenge CES to see the WP up against the iPhone and Android phones in simple tasks. The single core may get a laugh from some people but they simple don't understand that a big part of the equation is the OS. A lot of the test I have seen have Android phones getting destroyed by WP. I saw a WP turn off and on 4 times in the time it took an Android doing it once.Battery Life: outlast my Blackberry and expect to get a full day with moderate use. The best thing is that most of the notification require just a quick glance vs going through various menus. This will make your battery go further.Email: I have 4 emails all linked up to one Tile and with a number that appears telling me how many emails I have. Also, I like the look of the email and options you get within.Integration: I can control my Xbox from my phone. I can look through Netflix movies and/or Zune movies and search by cast or similar movies to determine what I want to watch next. Also, I can view messages and see who is online. I can also send messages and play games that will link up with my Xbox. You can do a lot with your Xbox on here.Also, People Hub and Me Tile allows Facebook, Windows Live, Twitter, Linkedin, etc. to all be updated and checked in one place. I never was a big user of these UNTIL I got a WP. Now I follow various twitter accounts that do news for my specific field and various blogs. In one glance I can see a short blurb on the article and I can click on the link to find out more.Live Tiles: I love this feature as you can see Facebook notifications, weather, calendar events, etc. in a quick glance. The weather app will also change when you move to a different location if you set it to (I do).Bing integration: I wasn't a big user of Bing until I got the phone. Voice Bing search is useful and with a  click on one button you can type your search. My favorite feature is Bing Maps here. Local Scout is awesome. Local Scout allows you to search your local area for attractions, food+drink, and shops allowing you to see reviews and sort them by types (Chinese food or star rating etc.). You can click the place and get a whole bunch of information. If you want to go there click the address and you can get directions from your current point. Just a few clicks vs searching online, copying address, opening maps, and then putting it in maps.Cons: Camera isn't great but isn't bad (front and rear facing). No Skype integration!!All in all it's a great first phone. Going back I would buy a phone with a larger screen. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:17:47	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

31249414	I honestly don't understand how CNET or individual purchasers can be lauding this phone when the display has been dimmed to such a great degree from the One X.  I have an iPhone 4.  Not even 4s.  I have to move the dimming slider to maybe 90-95% of maximum to make it approximately match the brightness of the HTC One X.  I have to dim it down to about 50% to match the One X Plus.  This is a DIM phone.  I consulted with sales staff at the ATT store, and they assured me what I was seeing was correct.  I called the HTC contact number for North America, and they assured me the dimming is intentional - to extend the battery life of the phone.  I presume this is because the One X Plus has a quad core processor (the One X had a dual core) which is more of a battery hog.  So, there you go.  That's the brilliant trade-off HTC made to speed up a phone that was already fast.  The dimness is substantial, and will definitely play havoc with sunny days.  Great phone, and terribly dim display means don't even think about this phone, in my humble opinion. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:17:47	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66649762	This was purchased as a specific request for a relative. She needed a Blackberry under a certain amount of money and the Bold 9000 was the only thing other than the older Curve and Tour models available.It's difficult to leave a practical review for a phone released in 2008. It feels its age, really dated. We've come strides and I own a Nexus 4. That being said, I will try to be as objective as possible.Personally, I truly believe that she would have been wholly better off with a cheap Android or Windows phone vs. this device. It is pretty much stuck as it is. There is no update possible. 4.6 is the last OS version unless modding is involved (by that I mean there's no official update). The phone has ~45MB of free space, but at least there's an SD Card.It works well and it is quick, so to speak. I haven't really seen any lagging so far and calls are crisp and clear. It has a 2MP camera and is 3G capable. It is a quad band phone so it works with most GSM carriers.This is focussed at the seller.One thing that I didn't like is that the phone is advertised by BLUTEKUSA as new but is reconditioned. I've owned cell phones for 15+ years and by now can definitely tell between a brand new unboxing vs. opening up something that is refurbished. Also, and this is the kicker - I've opened up brand new bold 9000s before, as well as other BB devices. There's even a scuff mark on the battery and side of the phone. It didn't come with a manual or those booklets you always throw out because they're useless anyway, earphones, usb cable, etc. I got the phone, battery and charger cable - that's it. I'm considering returning it because I could just buy a phone advertised as refurbished for 1/2 the price from other vendors on Amazon. It's pretty dishonest. Amazon needs to change their policies in terms of how vendors advertise items as new vs. refurbished.Update: BLUTEKUSA contacted me asking me to remove my 3 star feedback (not this review) that I gave them to which I politely declined. It wasn't even negative, per se. I just put the facts. As I said in my response to them, sometimes you only get one chance to make a customer happy. This is one of those cases, there is no opportunity for a do-over. I was to send the phone to a relative abroad through a visiting family member. I had no chance to even source an alternative or replacement elsewhere much less from Blutekusa, so I have to stand by my feedback and I will now remove 1 star from my review here because the last thing you should do as a store is ask a customer to remove negative feedback. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:19:09	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66161713	A whole new series of 3 megapixel phones are coming out now, so I can't say how this one compares to the others.  There is a new Samsung out that is about a half the size, but I don't know about the photoquality.  There are many factors that go into the quality of a photo, not just the megapixel count.  Other than the size and a few other things, I'm very satisfied with this phone/camera.  My overall goal was to be able to go out and about with only one electronics thing.  I dont want to carry my ipod, pda, camera, and phone everywhere.  This phone suffiently fulfills temporary and short-term outings.Here are the pros and cons.PROS:-Great screen, in terms of size and color-The phone/address book is very expandable, and can include unlimited phone numbers, addresses, and notes for each contact.  You can enter their address, birthday, whatever you want.  It syncs with Outlook, but I find that I only call regularly from my mobile phone a small portion of the people  from my outlook contacts.-Photos are very nice.  They are a bit smaller in file size than my old Sony 3.2 MP cybershot camera, but on the whole there is not much noticeable difference.  The daylight photos are great.  Low-light photos are very good for scenary, such as inside European churches, city streets, etc.  There is a very good image stabilizer, so the low-light photos are very good considering that my hands shake a lot.  Indoor people photos, however, are so-so.  This is true with any digital camera as a general rule.  But I've had problems with focusing (common) and sometimes i want to use the flash in the daytime (bright background, but person in shadow) and it doesnt always let me.  Still, it's convenient.-Great speaker sound, for music or speaker phone-Radio.  Nice add-on you don't get on a lot of the other 3.2 mp phones.-Good music playing.  Though you can't use your own headphones, you have to use the Sony ones that double as the hands-free microphone/headphones, the sound is very good.-You can copy and paste onto the memory card or phone any image photos and put them on your phone to show to people or for your own enjoyment.-Good battery life, if you don't have the screen lit up all the time.-I haven't used the 3G aspect of it, as this is expensive.  But the capability is nice.  Haven't tried out the internet either.-Despite the large size, it feels very comfortable to use.  It holds well in the hand, and the number pad keys are soft, though a bit close together.-Dedicated music play/pause button.-Good flash, with multiple flashes for red-eye reduction.-Nice leather hand strap.CONS:-Sending SMS to more than one person is a pain.  You have to go through several menus to select each person, one at a time.-Sony memory stick micro.  Yet another expensive sony memory card format.  MicroSD is the same size, and much cheaper.-Camera lens cover always sliding down.  The new Samsung and Nokia is much better in this respect. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:25:52	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

The radio quality was excellent and one did not have to be searching to find radio signals, the phone did that for you, but using the radio is a feature that diminishes the battery power quite easily. The phone is sturdily built and the quality over all is good, the only two negatives are that the phone needs to be updated with wifi to keep with the times and secondly i did not get to keep this phone long as it was stolen from me at work.

It is slim, and ultra-pocketable, the number buttons are large, but not too large.It seems to me that this phone does not exaggerate bars, meaning one signal bar is enough to make a reasonably clear call, although one signal bar is a rare circumstance for this phone, as it gets excellent reception compared with my two older phones (LG 1130, and a Motorola V3 RAZR).  Also, the battery status indicator seems to accurately portray how much time is left before charging is required (I ran it on 1 out of 5 bars out of the box for about 30 hours before deciding I should charge up).The screen is one of the easiest to read.  Daylight does not make this phone harder to read; in fact, more daylight increases the screen's readability.  Call quality is excellent with the exception of speakerphone mode, which is a little on the quiet side.Although this phone has a great share of positive features, primarily its affordable price-tag, it is guaranteedly not for everyone.  The main problem I have experienced so far is that the phone has no means of deleting phonebook entries.  Other problems are that the screen lacks the ability and complexity to display text similar to printed-text, and looks more like the readout of a calculator, with pre-set icons to indicate menu selection.  Because of this, letters (such as names) on the phone are displayed with CERTAIN CoMbINATIoNS oF CAPITAL ANd LoWERCASE LETTERS, regardless of which letters should actually be capitalized.Another issue I've had with this phone is that its more advanced settings require the use of certain button combinations to access. i.e. turning off the keypad sounds requires you to press the following combination ***250*^ and these combinations are only available in the phone's manual.  The other major issue is that this phone has no network update for date and time, which means that you'll have to enter the date and time when you start up and from that point forward it slowly becomes inaccurate over the course of several months, until you decide to re-enter the date and time.Overall, for someone who is looking for a no-frills way of making calls on a GSM network, this is an excellent phone, but for those who are more used to things such as a traditional color screen, and the option to do things other than text messaging and calling, this is definitely something to steer clear of. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:30:15	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

For $199, it will challenge even the $450 to $500 ranged phones available now, off contract. Go for it. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:32:11	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65373308	I think this phone is Verizon's best phone thus far.  It is a great phone, and is a nice combination upgrade of the top three phones from Verizon (LG Dare, LG enV3, LG Voyager).  The Blackberry Curve is VZW's top device, but I put that more as a PDA phone, rather than a regular phone with extra features (which is what the LG phones I listed above).  I've had many phones from Verizon for about 10 years now;  I have three lines in my account, and I upgrade my phone every year and the two other lines every other year.  IMHO this is the best phone to come out of Verizon.  The keyboard options are nice, though I find myself using the virtual keyboard more (I am used to the LG Dare).  I like the animated scroll (though not as nice as the HTC Touch Diamond or Pro, but again, these two are more data device/PDA phones, rather than regular phones).The screens for the LG enV Touch are quite nice, and definitely look a lot nicer than the LG Dare (and I like my Dare).  On paper, the LG enV Touch screens are better.  Both the internal and external displays of the LG enV Touch have 480x800 pixels, and 16 Million color levels (-vs- 240x400 pixels and 260K color levels on the Dare).  So it makes sense that the Touch screens look better.  (The Samsung Omnia screen is also 240x400 pixels and 65K color levels, so also inferior to the enV Touch).  If you have a chance, take a look at them side-by-side at your local store... you will see what I mean, and the difference will be quite obvious.The camera is quite impressive (3.2 MP) and the large screen size makes taking pictures a lot easier.  Daytime shots come out decent.  The night shots are not the greatest, but even regular cameras have problems with dark scenes.  I've tried the flash feature, and it helps a tiny bit (but I would never use it again. LOL!)I tested the data speed (via dslreports) and the reported speed was 812 kbit/sec, which is slower than my LG Dare (I got 1185 kbit/sec). I placed the phones on the same spot on my desk when I was running the tests, and ran one test per phone (one after the other) for 5 tests, and these are the average speeds of the 5 tests. I'm not sure why the Touch is slightly slower, given that both are EVDO Rev.A. I will next test the mobile broadband speed of both (results pending).  One huge benefit is that the unlimited data usage for this phone is only $15/month instead of the $30/month like the other data phones (blackberry, omnia, htc, etc.)The only negative feature I found was the disappointing battery life. I charge it overnight, take it off the charger at 7am, go to work, and by 2pm it has half the battery. This was consistent over the last 5 days I've had the phone.  If I leave the phone alone for an hour or so, when I get back to it the battery is up to 3/4 charged (I did not charge it).  I've even performed a hard reset (took the battery off while the phone was still on, waited over 30 sec, replaced the battery, turned the unit on, and charged overnight). No change in the battery life. I remember this was an issue with the LG Dare when it first came out a year ago, but the issue with the LG enV Touch is worse. I hope LG comes out with a fix for this (like they did with the Dare, and the battery life became significantly better).Altogether, I have been very happy and impressed with this phone. Having tested this unit thoroughly and extensively, I highly recommend this phone.  I am still running some more tests (bluetooth, mobile broadband  tethering, mobile web browsing, apps like VZ Navigator, etc.), and I will update this review in about a week.Having said all this, the LG enV Touch is a GREAT iPhone alternative, but is far from being an iPhone killer.  For those who are not on ATT and/or those who want to move from ATT, I highly recommend this phone.Pros:-Ext  Int screens are clear and large-Camera takes great pictures (for a phone)-FAST Mobile web...like my LG Dare-EVDO Rev.A so mobile broadband with tethering is FAST-dual keyboard (virtual and real)-decent speakers-clear sound for phoneCons:-battery life not very impressive. This is a pity, I actually gave thisphone 6 stars (out of 5) and docked one star for the battery, thus ending with 5 stars still. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:32:11	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
64281178	Below is my review of the 16GB model that I purchased in September. The two models are completely identical with the only exception being the additional 16G of storage space. Performance is totally unaffected by this....... Please note that this is strictly my opinion of the phone itself, I have no knowledge of this seller or the condition of the phones they sell.I had the 8GB 3G model and thought that was great, until I got a demo of the iPhone 4. Man is this version is light years ahead of the original model.With a 1Ghz CPU, and 16GB of flash memory, this thing is a portable office/entertainment center par excellence. I've had this phone for 3 months without a single problem, the display is nice and sharp, the apps load very fast, and I now have over 130 apps to perform just about every duty you could possibly think of with absolutely no impact on performance. And on the ATT 3G network, I average download speeds of around 1.8Mbps, and over 1M upload speeds....and how do I know that, cause I got an app that tells me that's how. BTW, the display is the equivalent of a 960x640 on your desktop (double the 3G model) so what you see is essentially a high res yield and page loads are superfast. And resident memory, after a full days use I just checked and still had 120Mb of Ram available. On the 3G model that number was usually down around 4Mb by the end of the work day and had to be refreshed.I was in the computer/design/manufacturing business for 20 years, and this is by far the most amazing piece of technology I have ever seen or imagined. Even the battery life is 3x better than the previous model, and thats a good thing cause its integrated but a full charge should yield and entire days work of calls, emails, surfing the web, SMS messaging, and play. I no longer need my laptop cause there's nothing I cant do with the iPhone, and that includes sending faxes, editing Excel or Word documents, and even printing. A flash for the 5MP camera, an HD video camera, and even real time video conferencing over a wireless network, and Bluetooth that unlike the 3G model is actually compatible with everything you throw at it, including Garmin GPS....just amazing. This thing even has 2 mics with noise suppression so calls are clearer on the other end. Man, Apple hit this one out of the park.BTW, with all the apps, music, and videos I've got loaded on this thing I've still got 10GB of flash memory remaining. I cant imagine why anybody would need more storage, and the 32GB model isn't any faster and doesn't have any more features. You'll need iTunes on your desktop to get the most out of this phone and iTunes can be a little intimidating at first but its worth the trouble, and all the instruction you need can be found on the web or Youtube for transferring photos, videos, music, apps, etc.Update 12/09/10: I've been reading up on the antenna problem with the iPhone 4G and have this to say.... It is easily cured by slapping on a hard case or shell on the phone, which eliminates the issue I see some people complaining about. I have personally never experienced this issue because I left the ATT; store with a protective shell on my phone which virtually everybody I've ever seen with an iPhone has anyway. Very simply you CANNOT replicate the reported death grip problem with a shell around the outer frame. Cant be done. And BTW, I don't know if its due to network improvements or what but lately I'm getting 4Mbps download speeds so if anything I'm happier with my purchase now than I was 4 months ago. Zero complaints, and that's something most smartphone users of other OEM products can't say.A final word: Beware negative reviews on here that are filled with bad English and are authored by individuals who have written only one review (on the iPhone) and posted it in several locations on Amazon's site. Its easy to pick these out, and they have no doubt been written by the same person. See the comments section for a definitive review on the Iphone 4 and the overblown antenna issue from Anandtech.comA final final word: Apparently this phone from Worldwide Distributors is LOCKED! If you plan to use this phone outside ATT;'s network you are screwed. All the one star reviews are from idiots that paid $800 for this phone without doing proper due diligence.Oh wait, I do have one complaint about the iPhone 4. Several times a month my girlfriend gets mad at me and hangs up in the middle of the conversation so I guess I'm suffering from this dropped call thing after all. haw haw 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:34:18	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66177626	I've only owned the Samsung Infuse 4G (using ATT) for a few days, but it is truly an impressive device. I would strongly recommend it to anyone considering a top-line smart phone. Period.My smart phone history is (recently) six Dell Streak 5s (which is an amazing device, but with a few flaws), a Blackberry Bold 9000, and temporarily (recently) an LG540.Samsung Infuse is a beautiful phone. Vivid display (clearer and larger than any similar smart phone), logical functionality (16 Apps per page that scroll sideways), and the flexibility of Android.It's capacitive touch screen works very well, and the onboard memory (and capacity to upgrade) is excellent.The only weak point is the battery, but I've only had the device for days and it's not quite fair to criticize quite yet. However, having said that, it seems that if you allow all manner of back-ground programs to run (which is what will happen - unless you intervene), that you may spend some part of your day re-charging this device just to keep it alive.However, experience users (e.g., ATT reps who own this device,  other US citizens) advise me that selecting Task Managers (installed) or Market-available task managers (free), will extend your battery's life well beyond default settings. Not sure yet, but it seems the battery will last the majority of the day IF you are not using Wifi, GPRS-web, running onboard programs to the max, and/or talking simultaneously throughout your day. Perhaps all that activity is unlikely, but it's possible.Purchase a protective case immediately. This device is very thin, and its form-facter offers very little built-in impact-absorbing space (none), and you'll need to add some survivability to put your mind at ease. I selected the Case Mate, and it fits as tight as a drum head, but seems to offer some impact resistance; haven't tested it, nor do I want to.The Power-up key (top right) seems a bit of an odd place, but this probably prevents it from being pressed inadvertently. The volume rocker keys (top left) function as you would expect (up-loud, down-quieter), which is a breath of fresh air (Dell Streak varied its volume rocker functionality based on whatever direction its AutoRotation determined was UP - which I found very strange).This is only a quick First Impression evaluation. But I must say, I am blown away by the absolute beauty of the large 4.5 display (not as big as Dell Streak 5, but much brighter and clearer), and the ease-of-use of Samsung Infuse. Infuse ships with a charger cable, wall adapter (no car power adapter is provided), an HDMI to phone plug (this phone will connect to your HDMI television for playback), quite nice ear buds (two extra different-sized ear bud sets), and a code sheet for one free HD movie. Loaded HD movies look amazing on this device, by the way.Email, Internet, Messaging, Phone use (speaker phone and handset, Application functionality, feel in-hand are all superb.I would buy this phone again. My competition was iPhone 4 (which has a lovely screen, but I found to be too small for the programs I use in my work: aviation weather programs; I'm not an Apple-hater, I own 9 Apple computers, but so far, I cannot cross the line into mobility with Apple; perhaps it is the iTunes strangle-hold that bothers me so much), Samsung Captivate, HTC Impress [all ATT so far], and US Cellular's offerings (nothing interested me), Sprint (same), Verizon's (all Droid phones - but their pricing was not attractive enough to swap service), and T-Mobile's smart phone offerings (which was/is very attractive - due to their cost-vs-benefit-%functionality ... and their unlimited data plans for 2 devices). Jury is not out yet, and the trial period for my ATT Infuse(s) has not expired. T-Mobile may yet get my business.But until then, and based on this device's performance only (notwithstanding the provider - which is hard to isolate!), I strongly recommend Samsung Infuse. Remember to purchase a protective cover  insure this device through Amazon's warranty service (i.e., SquareTrade) or you may need to buy another on your own dime.Cheers! 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:34:18	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
66903248	This Att Blackberry Z10 was an amazing deal. I had been on the prowl waiting for the affordable deal with Att. However I found this deal thru Amazon - of all places.  I kept my old Blackberry Bold 9900 no need to trade in and I was still able to get half off of the Att direct deal. Not really to my surprise ( I had read all the review Z10 ) this is an excellent smart phone and so easy to use.

64765846	Whoa! After reading a bunch of these reviews, I am quite shocked... I don't know what you guys do to your phones, but mine works amazing. I bought it on Craigslist for 50 dollars so i'm not sure what it's previous life was like save for a few scratches on the screen, but it works great. I will address some of the points made in other reviews.1. Battery life: It does die rather quick, but it's a smartphone. That's expected. It has all these apps running all the time. Mine used to last about a day then I downloaded a task killer and Juice Defender in the Android market and now I only charge every other day.2. Storage: most of the complaints are about internal storage and how most apps can't be stored in the SD card. This isn't the case with mine, I've stored all the apps I've downloaded in the SD card no problem. I have 15 Apps downloaded in my phone and it works very well with me. When it starts telling me that internal storage is full (and this is quite rare only happens perhaps twice a month) I don't need to delete my photos or texts. I go to manage my apps and clear the caches and the data to the apps. This ALWAYS makes that go away. It's usually the data on the browser that makes that pop out. Yes it does have a little bit of internal storage, but these are ways to get around that.3. Freezing: It hasn't froze on me yet (and hopefully won't) but the screen sometimes goes black like if it's on standby mode and it refuses to turn on.It doesn't do this too often so it doesn't phase me, I just pop out the battery and restart it and go about my day.4. Unmounting SD card by itself: Hah! does this to me very rarely! But it does happen. Who knows why... But It usually reads it all on it's own a few seconds after I find out what it's done. If not, I just pop out the SD card and pop it in again.5. Tapping a text thread and phone clicks different thread: Yeah, it does this too. Drives me a little crazy, but it also makes me laugh when I find out i've sent the wrong text message to someone i wasn't even texting in the first place. I guess my phone is humorous like that. However, I don't really encounter many problems clicking links in the browser or on apps. Just really likes pulling the bait and switch on my texts :)6. I read a review in which someone said that their phone was falling apart or something... umm... I have no idea what to say about that. Like I said, I purchased this used on Craigslist and all I have as evidence as to it's treatment in the hands of it's previous owner are some scratches to the screen and normal wear and tear. Uh, but my phone is not falling apart. It's very much intact and still in one piece. But I rarely drop it and I invest in cases and screen protectors for it so.. what are you guys doing to your phones?7. Lastly, someone said it was slow. Maybe I don't have to much experience with smartphones being this is the first one i've owned... but I have no trouble loading up youtube videos. Sometimes it can take a few moments to load up facebook or a browser page but it doesn't bother me. I guess i'm too patient... But what do you really expect from a smartphone from 2010? It's not a 4G LTE or any of the hot new stuff. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:39:53	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64774978	The specs on the Droid X are impressive, however buying a Motorola phone has become a terrible idea with their current trends.  Motorola has delayed updates to their current phones multiple times (Motorola Cliq users are up in arms as I type this since Motorola is the ONLY Android phone manufacturer that this has phones operating Android 1.5.  See [...] for more info).On top of poor support Motorola is locking capabilities out of their phones to prevent the owners of said phones from upgrading the phones themselves (as of right now Motorola is the only Android manufacturer to do this).The Droid X is a pretty nice phone when you look at the specs, but it is by no means a top of the line phone.  Phones like the HTC Evo, the Nexus One, and Samsung's new Vibrant line are all better alternatives when you look at nothing more than phone specs.  Add in Motorola's continued degradation in service and you're simply looking at purchasing a future headache in the Droid X. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:39:53	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64368905	My wife and I have had Nokia phones for the last 10 years. We have been very pleased. On 2009 we bought the N71 model. Great phone, very reliable, easy to use, sturdy, and an excellent all around phone. Because my phone had suffered a lot of abuse during the yeas, and after giving a lot of thought to it, we decided to order to new N71 phones, as we were so happy with the ones we had.The mistake: Buying this old (produced in 2009) phones as if they were new. Since day 1 my phone presented problems with the Bluetooth. After 1 week, the phone lost the ability to recognize the service provider. I changed SIMs with my old phone, and it was working, installed it in my wife's new phone, it was working, installed it in my new phone, a no service message will be shown.We thought that maybe I had bad luck and I had gotten a lemon.On my wife's phone, which we had chance to try, the software was very different than the one provided in the normal N71 (N71x was produced for ATT;, and some functions were limited, some wireless capabilities were blocked, and all the software was limited to those apps approved by ATT.; Not good). If you liked the Nokia mail app, sorry, can't use it with this phone. Want to use the ATT; mail service? No can't do, it's no longer available. This is what you will find all the time with this phone. Things don't work, they are no longer available, or their capabilities are limited.Make yourself a favor and look for a more recent phone.We are now iPhone users. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:41:34	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66403904	I did not get what I wanted which was the Samsung Galaxy ii BUT I did get what I Needed.  It fits me like a glove and within my budget as well.  I am very glad it worked out this way.  The phone is easy to read/use and clean.  Tracfone has come a long way since I used them last.  I always liked the phones they offer just not the way they calculated time.  I always felt cheated.  This phone however tracks your minutes and you always know how much time is left on you phone and when you need to buy more.  If you have minutes left over they carry over if you purchase more before you run out.  You can buy minutes at several places and online or on your phone.  I really like that.  The triple minutes for life will help cut the cost of having a portable cell.  I highly recommend this phone for use by adults or kids. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:44:45	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64270847	Got this phone about 30 days ago and love it.  It's very quick to respond, the speakerphone is very loud and clear (first time I've experienced that in a cell phone), the internet and music player are easy to use and the contact management is good.  The camera also has auto focus and takes pretty good pictures that print clearly onto a 4x6 photo.  Voice dialing works great.  Another nice feature is that you can save favorite settings, etc. for the camera and quickly get to them (such as night or flash on always).  I've dropped it once and didn't find any scratches.  I've since gotten a case for it just in case.  All in all, a very good phone. 	l3g4cy	10-26-2015 02:47:34	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
69137646	The hardware folks failed on this device. The only saving grace is the Windows Phone 8 OS.First, the device is entirely too heavy. What is all the weight for? I just don't know, because usually it's the battery that carries the bulk. And yet the battery life is terrible, as many other users have reported. I can charge in the evening, unplug when I go to bed, and have it at half-charge in the morning. What happens overnight? Gremlins use my phone?The camera is as mediocre as other phone cameras I've used. Takes too long to focus, the flash is very spotty and the colors are underwhelming. I know some folks are very pleased with it, but I don't understand how it's better than any other camera-phone.The one thing it does well is run the OS well (while using too much juice). I really enjoy Windows Phone 8, especially the integration with cloud services and social networks. Messaging, email and web all work very well with smart features that don't add bloat or leave me wanting for functionality. It's a very nice refinement of WinPhone 7.After six months with this device, I'm afraid I won't make it to the end of my two-year contract. I may just go back to my Samsung Focus. The weight, battery life and fragile screen are tough to bear. I could live with WP7, if I had to. Next time, I'll go back to Samsung for a Windows phone. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 07:26:59	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Other	Applications	Software	switch to other device	false

65677691	I bought this phone for my 89 year old father who has Parkinson's disease (limited tactile mobility) and some hearing loss. So far, so good. Although his vision isn't really good enough to use the menu screen, he hears voices more clearly on his cell phone than his land line. The key pad is responsive enough that he usually dials accurately.Assuming he remembers to carry it with him (a problem, since he won't wear the lanyard I bought), it improves our ability to speak with him regularly and improves the quality of his life. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 07:26:59	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
9247449	Phone is great. I've had this for few months now.There is huge community that helps with development of Custom ROMs and Kernels, and that covers up flaws that Nexus 4 has.....Since its one of the few first generation quad core phone, with small battery it does run out quite fast even with Google trying to help with it by throttling the speed of phone when heated. So far CM+Franco Kernel was the best Battery saver for me, but if you find better combination please comment below.Another Flaw is the Navigational bar, which can also be fixed with any Custom ROM. Not all apps in the market is built to Google's new design guides. A lot of apps don't have the three dot buttons(Essentially a menu button). The virtual bar does pop up a small one on the side if it detects there isn't one, but trying to find where these things are in each app can get annoying. Again I am running CM with Menu button on my Virtual bar, but most of the time I have expanded desktop with LMT launcher(which is just Pie control in app form) on... that allows me to have other apps in short cut when I bring it up.Speaking of Virtual navigation... it does take up considerable amount of screen like I said above, most ROMs will give your ability to get rid of it or make it smaller. Paranoid Android ROM is great at this, but Battery life needs to be sacrificed a bit to use it.TLDR : I can be THE BEST PHONE EVER, IF your adventurous enough to use Custom ROMs and Kernels. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 07:26:59	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

21584842	About a full week after replacing a well-used, but oh-so-deficient Samsung Infuse 4G -at a time when the iPhone 5 simply ain't all that, and when the Galaxy S3 is almost outdated, and S4 still an unannounced mystery... I was wondering what ELSE could possibly be out there-  and hold muster.  BINGO!  This HTC One X+ is simply smokin'...  beautiful screen, lightning quick speed, and oh, did I forget 64 GB out of the box (about 57GB was usable after Android/ATT bloatware).  Battery life is typical for daily surfing/email/music/apps.  About a full day's use per charge, so not great... but no hardworking smartphone will blow you away with 3 days of battery-lifeMy first go-round with an HTC product, but I've always seen them with fairly high marks given, and this latest version is another well-deserved rendition.  Has some really great features, including Power Saver mode, Beats Audio amplifier, REALLY nice finish and 4.1 Jelly Bean, I was hooked in a few days, after I easily re-loaded my Google apps and added previous contacts (used the one-time ATT app to transfer,  pretty smooth!)The black rubbery finish is just classy, and all-but-guaranteed to be less drop-prone than my former slick-sided Samsung/iPhone's.  Nice to touch, and hold.  The Gorilla glass used by HTC is bar-none the best I've ever seen on a smartphone.  It is MUCH less prone to fingerprints/smudges, etc.  I was constantly cleaning my old Infuse screen, but can hardly find smudges after heavy use on this one.  Would HIGHLY recommend a test drive at any ATT store... oh, and don't pay the $199 upgrade, I got it on Amazon for $60 bucks LESS, and 2-day delivery! 	jwilets	10-26-2015 09:20:11	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

75340316	Many of the reviews you'll find for mobile phones are paid or fake reviews. Mine is not. I'm a long time iPhone and Android owner who's switching my app development from the iOS platform to the Windows platform.I was always fairly happy with my iPhone 4. Fragmentation on the Android platform was a nightmare so it pushed me to iPhone. But I have felt like Apple has been fairly stagnant since the 4 in terms of pushing the envelope. (That's not to say I was unahppy. I really like what Apple brings to the table).I now own both the 920 and the HTC 8X. The 920 is a phenomenal device. The screen, the camera, the Windows 8 OS - all far exceed my experience with Apple. The quality of hardware is unmatched on the market right now, in my opinion. The feel in your hand, the smooth interaction with the OS, all of these things make this phone and this platform the best on the market right now.The apps are coming. I've been developing apps for the iOS platform for years now. And I think developers see a gold rush and an untapped market with Windows Mobile now that they have some legitimate hardware in play. If you go with this phone, know that all your favorite apps may not be there from day one, but they're right around the corner. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 09:20:11	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65217698	This product is all it is advertised.  I received it from Amazon prior to the expected arrival date in new condition.  It was in an unlocked condition so I can use it on any GSM network.  This is my first Android smartphone and so far it does everything I desire from a cellphone.  The screen resolution is good and the screen size, while only 3.65 inches is adequate for doing Emails and online websites. The phone size is perfect, not too big and not too small.  The 1Ghz processor speed is very fast also compared to the Nokia C6 I had before.  Samsung did an automatic update of the software (2.3 Gingerbread) the first time I went to their website.Calls are clear and texting is ok, though somewhat slow due to the small size of the screen and my large hands. I got spoiled using the slideout keyboard on the Nokia (unfortunately it broke after 18 months).  The 5mp camera takes great pictures.  A great phone and I highly recommend it for the price ($240) and quality. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 09:30:32	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65967960	The phone is just okay and lacks so many features that are possible now days. Does have some that are very good for the money.By that I mean, I have a Motorola W376G and it has a radio built in. Also has a flip cover which this does not. This has the ability to record voice, but does not have the ability to do so easily... or record a call in the middle of it... at least that I found.What it does have is the ability to transfer pictures from you phone without mailing them but for free using a USB cord (not included but cheap at many stores). But sadly it is only a 1.3 megapixel camera.Now it does have a huge amount of storage 4gb on a microSD card (also not included but cheap on amazon) so you can use it to carry important pictures, documents, sound files etc which you can put on through the USB cord from your computer.The instruction manual that comes with it is very poor.The right sellers have cheap minutes you can buy for the camera with some great deals every now and then.Last year Tracfone had some special that doubled my minutes (right around Christmas) and took my user active functioning date to the year 2072!The lack of being a flip phone is the part that bothers me the most. As is the lack of a radio. Also, having a stylus would be nice to work the small keys, but again you can buy them here on Amazon.On the good side is the ability to transfer pictures from the camera to your computer for free without sending them (at a minutes cost).This tracfone also does not have any smartphone features or the ones it does have are minimal.. at least not up to so many other phones on the market.But the price is so great it does make up for the features and functions it lacks. So overall not a terrible buy.Oh, but one major bad feature is Tracfone tech support. It is slow and terrible and very few of their techs speak good English so it is hard to get through even minor calls with any speed. My fone came in in Spanish and it took 3 Hours to get tech support (5 different techs) to understand what I wanted to do.... make it display in English. When I finally got a tech who understood what I needed to do it to about 2 minutes.Also watch out for the Internet button (on the front beside the other buttons and clicking it by accident (easy to accidentally do as it is also the ON/OFF button and depends what other buttons are already pushed) costs you at least 1.5 minutes!!!!.I have had other tracfones and got thru using them easily. This has been a chore so far.3 hours of my life to change the language(plus more time looking functions up online with my computer) have bothered me about this phone.My W376G is a blessing (yes I still have two of them). Considering all this, this phone which will only ever be a back up phone... but that will cost minutes too ... :-( oh well.// it was cheap and the seller was good too! 	jwilets	10-26-2015 09:32:42	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64342886	I had an unlocked Galaxy S4 ($800).  Everyone knows all the specs and features of that phone.  It took one fall, and it was done.I got this Galaxy Grand Duos ($350) as a replacement.  I didn't know what to expect, but so far, I'm pretty happy with it.GOOD:-I didn't use all of the S-features on the S4, but I'm happy MOST of them are on the Grand Duos (I can't seem to get all of them to work, but on the same note, I couldn't get them to work on the S4 either.  I use 2 screen mode a lot, and I'm happy it's on the Grand Duos)-specs say that the screen resolution is not as good as the S4, but I honestly can't tell the difference-the interface is much like S4 and Note, so it's very easy to use and to get help with (ie screen shots, 2 screens, awake with voice are the same process/commands on all Galaxies).-call quality is clear and consistent.-it's bigger than the S4 and smaller than the Note (which is perfect for me!)-battery life is actually better than it was on the S4 for me (possibly bc of the lower screen resolution)-it looks great, and I'm in the #34;Galaxy#34; club, without any contract/subsidies, and for a fraction of the price of the Note and S4.  While I can tell it from the S4 and Note very easily, other people can't (except a Samsung representative noticed every difference instantly)-it has things the Note and S4 don't have (dual sim for avid travelers, FM radio, minimal bloatware with just the essentials and a few Samsung apps)-it looks expensive enough that I'm proud to have it out, but it's secretly cheap enough that it's still replaceable if lost/stolen/broken on a tripBAD:-the camera is not as good.  It takes decent shots, but with 8 MP (vs the 16MP on the S4), you notice that you are missing some detail, especially when you zoom.  If the focal point is distant and detailed, it comes out a little muddled. Good quality up close and without zoom,  Also, if it has all the nifty camera features like the Note and S4, I haven't found them yet.  So far, it just seems to be run-of-the-mill camera options-if the Grand Duos has 4G, I can't seem to find it-I don't think it has scroll with eyes or look away pause, but you can scroll with tilt and turn over to pause (I haven't used them yet, but they're there in the settings menu.  On a positive note, a lot of those extra features on the S4 and Note are battery drainers anyway)-fewer awesome accessories available (like docks, magnetic covers, etc)-it comes with a European plug (my seller tossed in an adapter, and I already had a few anyway.  I'm definitely planning on ordering an American OEM Samsung charger)-the speaker is perfect for making calls;  even on a mount in the car, there is no trouble communicating with the mic and speaker.  However, when I play music, it's a little quieter that I remember the S4 being.-Less internal storage space than the S4, the Grand Duos has 4GB internal (I read there would be 8GB, but my phone says 3.94GB internal space).  I have a ton of apps (all internal for now), and a few songs and pics (most of my media is on my SD and all of it is backed up to cloud).Other things to note:-I thought the earphones jack didn't work, but you really have to push it deep in there until you hear a click.-both SIM slots are for the standard (large) SIM cards.  I used my same mini SIM card from my S4, but taped it in to a SIM adapter ($1 on Amazon, $5 at T-mobile store if you can't wait for shipping).  I didn't have it taped, and my phone stopped working one night.  The next day, I took it to T-mobile, and she just taped the top.  I haven't had any issues since)Do I recommend this product?  --All the time!Am I happy with this purchase  --Absolutely!Will I get it again?  --If I lose this one and the next generation isn't here, then of course I will get this same phone again.  Ideally, I would like to keep this phone as my international phone for trips, and get the S5 for the US when it comes out (if the camera is better than the Nokia Lumia 1020) 	jwilets	10-26-2015 09:32:42	Complaint	Other	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Enclosure	phone fell apart easily	false

27204607	This is really a great phone. Elegant construction, very classy. The PureView camera is awesome, and the screen is the best I have seen. It is really easy to read in the sunlight, and the colors just pop. As a GREAT added plus, you get Nokia Drive and Maps for free, which are the best there is. Free streaming music from Nokia Music app (ad-free), is just another killer bonus. Plus, Nokia does not abandon you once you buy their phones; they are the best when it comes to pushing software updates to their customers.Finally, go look online for the drop test videos. Remarkable. This thing is solid. About as unbreakable as a phone can get. No bumper-covers needed for this baby. Overall, a great phone from a great company. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 09:36:11	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

Like I said, its a very basic phone, if you want frills, don't get it, if you just want to be able to talk to people and send text messages (even though it can be a pain to type them all out) then this is a decent, cheap phone. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 11:06:38	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64368905	My wife and I have had Nokia phones for the last 10 years. We have been very pleased. On 2009 we bought the N71 model. Great phone, very reliable, easy to use, sturdy, and an excellent all around phone. Because my phone had suffered a lot of abuse during the yeas, and after giving a lot of thought to it, we decided to order to new N71 phones, as we were so happy with the ones we had.The mistake: Buying this old (produced in 2009) phones as if they were new. Since day 1 my phone presented problems with the Bluetooth. After 1 week, the phone lost the ability to recognize the service provider. I changed SIMs with my old phone, and it was working, installed it in my wife's new phone, it was working, installed it in my new phone, a no service message will be shown.We thought that maybe I had bad luck and I had gotten a lemon.On my wife's phone, which we had chance to try, the software was very different than the one provided in the normal N71 (N71x was produced for ATT;, and some functions were limited, some wireless capabilities were blocked, and all the software was limited to those apps approved by ATT.; Not good). If you liked the Nokia mail app, sorry, can't use it with this phone. Want to use the ATT; mail service? No can't do, it's no longer available. This is what you will find all the time with this phone. Things don't work, they are no longer available, or their capabilities are limited.Make yourself a favor and look for a more recent phone.We are now iPhone users. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 11:06:38	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

46426718	I bought this for use in Europe, where I am a student and need a sim capable phone.  The company that sold it and the phone itself are incredible.  I think someone commented earlier that it came from England, I believe they're right because mine also came with a British prong plug, however, a converter is included so it's useable in N. America as well.  The speed is spectacular, the camera is excellent (even in poorly illuminated areas).  To give you an idea, I placed a clear screen protector on the phone and my friend couldn't even tell.  It is pricey, but you'll be very happy for a long time.  It's top of the line, it's fast, I doubt you'll ever need more than 64 gb of memory.  It is microsim, but any phone repair shop can cut it for $5.  The screen is definitely cleaner and clearer than the Samsung S3.  There was one glitch, which happened during an update.  While updating it lost connection to the internet and it got blocked in what I thought was the infamous #34;airplane mode#34; (google it).  However, it was merely a coincidence, I reinstalled Jelly Bean and it runs beautifully.  It's definitely for people with bigger hands, I'm 6'2 and the phone looks normal in my hands, while for other people it's #34;huge#34;.  Also, the audio is excellent, I tested it with beats headphones and it's...it sounds multidimensional, very crisp and clear.  The ear buds you get with it are nothing special, but if you have beats headphones, it's definitely worth it.  Definitely love this phone, highly recommend. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 11:26:15	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

35792875	Having had in the past HTC's, Nokia N81 unlocked(which was my favorite and in my opinion the most advanced at the time, expect for iPhones keyless keyboard) iPhones and Samsung galaxy2. I was in the market for an upgrade. Judging from past experiences and researching and reading reviews...I knew I didn't want another iPhone, as many have said not much innovation thru the years(my Nokia N81 had video calling 6yrs ago even thou no carriers in the USA provided the service)yes some tweaks here and there, yes they are lighter but most definitely more fragile. I see many people walking around with cracked screens especially iPhones and galaxy 3s, the one great thing about the iPhone 3GS was it's build and quality it can take a beating and not break.I was very close to purchasing a galaxy 3 nice looking screen good sound better than iphone 5 in my opnion, but something about the build didn't quite convince me so I decided to wait for the Nokia Lumia 920 and check it out (wasn't ever interested in Samsungs Note 2, way to large). I'm glad I waited for the 920 It feels like a premium device it reminds me of the iPhone 3GS great quality, the screen is beautiful, the color options are great(got a yellow one), Windows 8 OS works great for me the live tiles are a breath of fresh air you run you finger along the screen everything has a smooth feel, great speakers, the Nokia apps are great Nokia music pretty much unlimited music, Nokia city lens is an innovative app, Nokia offline GPS app and on are all free. NFC, Yes finally wireless charging, I lost count of how many chargers I've purchased for my Iphone. Last but not least...the camera it's awesome in dark light conditions its like magic you can't believe it, and it shoots great videos as well with image stabilization...having kids this phone is great don't have to worry about carrying a separate camera.Some people say the 920 might be on the hefty side, but if you put a case on your phone the weight is about the same, the 920 doesn't need a case checkout the YouTube videos out there.The App Store doesn't have nearly as many apps available that you can get on a iPhone or Android stores, but I have most of what I need. The OS is new so more apps will be available soon, I can see the difference in the month I've had the device they've multiplied.Some minor things might need to be tweaked with the OS, but I've been getting updates which is good, they seem to be addressing the issues. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 11:26:15	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

However, the silver colored plastic on the face of the phone started peeling (from contact with skin oils, perspiration, etc.) after owning it only 6 months or so. I researched it and other people who contacted Nokia got replacement phones that did the exact same thing within a few months. I was a loyal Nokia customer for over 10 years (my first phone circa 1997 was a Nokia). Needless to say, I am no longer a Nokia customer. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 12:51:31	Neutral	Other	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Enclosure	casing issues	false

They had to install so called Gevaway SIM, and now every time I switch off and on my phone I have to do several steps as some tricky password to make phone to find network and just to remind you I bought phone as UNLOCKED! 	jwilets	10-26-2015 12:59:29	Complaint	Unable to Use	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

64543837	I sync my Treo with my apple computer and have no problems (you'll need the missing sync software). The Treo itself has some issues that have disappointed me, however:Like all PDA Operating Systems (OS's), including Windows, they tend to crash a lot. What I've discovered is that this OS is extremely stable but only when I load the right programs. It's like driving a car, but only down certain streets, or you'll fall off a cliff. It's hit-or-miss adventure; you'll have to load programs one at a time and after a few days, see if they created any problems or crashes. If not, then you should have no issues with crashes; then go ahead and load the next one. If you experience problems, you can delete it and it will resolve the crash issue. But not being able to use a program (especially a much needed one) is very disappointing and a downfall for some users like me. This hugely limiting factor seems to make my Treo resemble more of an expensive organizer. Some folks simply live through the PDA crashes but I can't adjust to it. You need to count on some good luck and hope a program will not cause problems. The good news is that the few times it has crashed, I never once lost my data and could go on using my PDA as before. This is important if you're not near your computer for a sync. You simply unscrew the tip of the stylus to reveal a pin that you can use to hit the tiny reset button. The Treo re-boots with all my data, contacts  calendar intact.Bluetooth: The lack of bluetooth is also a bummer. I did not think I would need bluetooth, but now realize its usefullness. As technology improves, this Treo is at a disadvantage.Phone contacts: You can easily pop in your sim card but you can't save or utilize the phone book on your sim card. You'll have to either import your contacts from your computer or type it into the phone manually. This is not a good feature if you pop your sim card between different phones.Internet: Good colors  graphics, but connection is slow. A real pain to type quickly with the thumb keyboard.Portability: This Treo is quite bulky and heavy. It's not one that you can simply throw in your pocket and go hang out in the park with. It gets in the way and fits better in your handbag or briefcase. But then you might not hear the phone or feel it vibrate, which is defeating.Photos: The quality of the pictures are not very good. You can easily set the phone to display a picture of your caller, but that's not a remarkable feature.Graffiti: You can't write graffiti style on the screen. You have to use the thumb keyboard or type it in with the sylus.To Do List: If you accidently tap the box next to a To-Do-List item, it will delete your note and sometimes you can't undo the action, so be careful.For most of these issues, there are folks selling third party solutions. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.There are some pluses: the Treo is a quad-band phone. I use T-Mobile in NYC and get great reception. I also travel all over the world to places like India, Egypt,  West Africa and call home with perfect reception. It has a never ending call-log that has helped me in many ways. The battery lasts a long time and charges quickly.Personally, I think this Phone/PDA is too expensive, too heavy and needs some upgrading. The PDA/phone market is slowly improving but it needs a lot of work. If you must buy this Treo, keep a small cellphone nearby so you can pop in your sim card and throw the cellphone in your pocket when you want to travel light. Otherwise, you'll be tied down to the Treo's bulkiness when you don't need it. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 13:08:22	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Enclosure		false

40772432	From the Palm Pilot days to my last Samsung Infuse Android.. I have had a lot of devices and Smart Phones.  The Lumia 920 is a very well made phone with a fantastic screen.  My first few days with it were wonderful, the OS is a joy to use.  Easy to navigate but full of features to make things interesting.  No slow downs, freezing, or resets.  The choice of fonts, contrast, and screen clarity make it a joy to use.  Then on day four I only made it thru half the work day...  never had a battery die so quickly.  I turned off wifi on day 5 and made it thru work and almost home before the battery gave up.  No video use, a little music, a blue tooth headset, phone calls, a few small searches on the net, check weather and it's almost gone.  I would have thought it was a bad phone but I'm seeing other users with battery issues (that they say improve over time).  The only thing I'm sure that time cures is return rights.*** UpdateEnding up keeping the phone and yes the battery life improved.  I'm not sure why and I've never had it happen on a phone before, but it was like it needed a few charges discharges to get it's full power.  I would now rate this phone 6 stars (If I could).  Some reviews will say it's heavy, no it's very well made and solid. The first phone that I think could survive everyday use and drops without a case.  Plus we are talking ounces here, heavy really...  Best screen I have ever seen (and the Infuse was great).  Clear, bright, vibrant, easy to read, and no glare.  Everything just works and works well. The auto adjust on brightness is the first I have been able to leave on.  Most phones try to stay on the dim side and then adjust at odd times for no reason.  I never notice the Lumia adjusting, it just seems to pick up the correct brightness for the conditions and stays there.  I'm in computer support so I see a lot of interfaces.  The Lumia Windows OS is fantastic.  Anyone who picks the phone up understands the interface within minutes.  Microsoft looked at the existing systems and then designed one for actual smartphone use.  It's not complicated or 10 levels deep, so everything is close to the main menu and easy to get to. No lags or slowdowns on this phone, movement is crisp.  Everyone knows the camera is the best on any smartphone so that was a given.  Low light shots are great and the camera stabilizes so well it looks like you used a tripod.  Daylight shots are no better than any other high end smartphone but the video and low light shots are where it shines.  Great Job Nokia and Microsoft 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 13:15:26	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64569558	I got this phone about three weeks ago to replace my LG Optimus T. I liked the Optimus T, but felt it was a little laggy when running apps and the screen was smaller than I really wanted. This phone initially seemed perfect: bigger screen, bigger memory, better camera. All of that is true and I really enjoy all of those aspects of the phone.My biggest complaint is the text messaging. The phone, out of box, has some pretty bad texting problems that can be found across the t-mobile board (wish I had seen those earlier!). Messages fail constantly; some messages that fail have more than 160 characters, other are short messages. It took me five minutes to get an Ok! sent to one of my employees. If this problem didn't exist, this phone would be a 4-star for me, but both Samsung and T-Mobile support don't seem to want to do anything about this problem. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 13:22:09	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Other	Applications	Software		false
64818883	Been using my Nokia 603 for over half a year thus far. Would not give it up for any other phone on the market for the balance of security vs. features it offers!Lots of solid features in this phone at this price range. Exceeds what you can get vs. any other phone out there when balancing out features vs. security vs price.Screen is amazingly bright! In a direct comparison with the iPhone 4S, with both the 4S and 603 turned to maximum brightness, the 603 easily matches the 4S and is perhaps a touch brighter. Certainly, the 701 has an even brighter 1000 nit rated display, but these phones are already bright-enough to see clearly in direct sunlight.Here, the messaging covers all available types - SMS, MMS, voice messaging, email - as well as the ability to download attachments and include attachments of any type. Built-in QuickOffice allows you to read Office documents and PDFs, while an inexpensive upgrade allows for full editing. Opening PDFs of 300+ pages pose no problem at all, and scrolling through such ebooks is quick and easy due to the fast CPU. Later, in an upcoming release of Belle this year, Microsoft Web Apps will be fully integrated as well - quite exciting! The built-in text-to-speech allows you to have the phone read texts to you if you so choose. And ZIP program lets you open up *.zip attachments.Email allows for IMAP, POP and connectivity to common webmail services such as Yahoo! Mail. Naturally, it's a one-stop service that allows you to easily integrate multiple accounts into one handy mailbox to check on-the-go. Threading and non-threaded views are available depending your preference, too.The built-in web browser handles most websites without a problem and the built-in Flash Player allows you to visit many streaming video sites that you cannot with other phones that lack such. The popular YouTube videos open up in the built-in video player full-screen, and Flash web advertisements can be seen across various sites.Of note, the free YouTube Downloader app instantly lets you surf across YouTube and download any video in 360, 720, or 1080 formats to your memory card! When used over a WiFi connection, you can load your phone with videos to watch on-the-go and avoid expensive 3G data charges. An extremely convenient app that is a must-have for any heavy video nut!Additionally, the free Nokia Internet Radio app allows you to play all of the streaming Shoutcast and other standard online radio feeds all day long. Quite nice when you've run out of FM radio options.The Nokia 603 uses a hyperfocal lens, meaning it is set so that everything from about 50cm to infinity is in sharp focus.The single disadvantage is that when framing something smaller than a standard piece of paper, the images will be fuzzy. Thus, when you attempt to take photos of small objects, you must keep your distance and crop later.The big advantage is that you do not ever wait for the camera to focus ala slow iPhones! Since everything is always sharply focused from 50cm out, you can take photos as quickly as the phone allows, and move about when taking videos while not worrying about unfocused subjects. This is a very nice feature for most users and takes that problem of fuzzy focus away from blessed 603 users.The white balance is generally very good - sunlit koi in ponds to snaps of buildings and people come out as expected - contrast, sharp, richly colored, vibrant. Slight shifts indoors and at night, but still quite accurate and realistic. Both video and photos are sharp enough to replace an iPhone 3Gs with (which also has a 5MP camera), so no worries here.Videos are recorded at 720p at ~12,000kbits/second H.264/AVC, which is more than sufficient for nice-looking video recordings. Zooming is allowed during videography by pressing the volume buttons or on-screen controls. The zoom moves smoothly through the fine steps, so you can easily frame without much worry.The usual slew of mapping features are included. Search, 3D mode, terrain and satellite, night view, walking and driving naviagation with a slew of voice languages to pick from for voice navigation prompts.GPS, A-GPS, WiFi, cell tower, etc. methods are are available for triangulating your position, and each can be turned off to save money or power. Signal lock with cellular assist takes only a dozen seconds at most.Maps for almost all major travel destination countries in the world are Free and can be downloaded using your computer or the phone to memory for offline use forever. Naturally, a 16GB+ MicroSD card is recommended due to the large map size if you choose to download multiple locations. Quite nice since you do not have to pay any money for data usage once maps are downloaded at one go.In the end, an excellent upgrade from a 5230/5800/etc. S60 5th, and one of the nicest smartphones available that's packed with many free, useful features, some that are not available on other platforms. A reasonable $220-240 USD price point. The Nokia 701 does add an 8MP camera, FM Transmitter, and a 1000 nit display, but certainly nothing most would miss with the Nokia 603.Naturally, if apps are your main focus, an Apple iPhone will be the best choice with the largest app store around.Apple's solid commitment to providing three generations of OS upgrades for iPhone buyers is great (ie. 3Gs started with iOS 3, then got 4, and now 5), and Nokia does a good job at providing updates for 2-3 years after each model has been released.Thus, if you use your phone mainly for the basics noted, and not dilly-dally with games, the Nokia 603 an excellent choice for those upgrading from older Symbian models and even other platforms for the added benefits (FM Radio, MicroSD card slot, Free GPS voice navigation and maps, 16:9 ClearBlack display, dragdrop; media, security). 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 13:22:09	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
66901726	This was a phone i was purchasing as my first contract phone ever, i have always used pay as you go or contract free phones/plans. The immediate difference was the quality of all the services i had, internet was fast and no matter where i went i had service(this is more about the provider i went with) but after these, the smaller, less noticeable details began to show. First, the stylus(s-pen) works amazingly with this phone, every feature i used worked just as well, and some even better using this, texting, navigating web pages, and using almost any app. Next was the quality of the things it did, whenever i would run apps that on my other phone that would have a delay, it kept on going strong, pandora, emulators, and multiple tabs of internet, all of them and more ran perfectly. And the thing i like the most on the phone is the motion commands. While sometimes they are not very necessary, they are fun to do and give a variety and the things i can do with the phone. Last, is the sheer size of this phone, it is MASSIVE, and it is amazing, i have had the phone for over a month now, i got used to it in about 2 days, and now all other phones just seem tiny and i don't see a reason to ever want a phone that small again. i recommend this phone 1000%! 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 13:22:09	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

The price is a little higher than other sellers. Amazon didn't do a good job on packing the phone. Not in a box, but in a yellow paper bag. :(The phone is very wonderful. I use my bf's G-phone4 Nexus LG, the picture quality makes a big difference. Nokia does a great job, everything at night looks very clear. I can see my finger tip clearly when I take a close picture.

I like to be special. :)Plus, iphone is easy to break. haha.The sound quality may not as good as apple. maybe because of the headphone.I trust Nokia.The only weird thing that happens is that the calendar shows up Arabian even if i type in Chinese. It changes to Arabian when I see the table calendar. However, when I click it, it shows Chinese. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 13:26:07	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Settings	Software		false

Even though I had deleted all my emails on my home computer, when I got my new phone and synced it, it downloaded thousands of emails that had been deleted. Apple still has no way to delete mass emails even though we have all requested it or least help with this issue they have created for us. Voice search still needs tweaked. You have to practically yell for it to understand you.  The calendar doesn't have flexible options for scheduling. It is very basic.

My sim card worked fine in the phone. I was able to call, text, and set my ringtones the way I wanted. The only problem is this phone is NOT a U.S phone. My provider couldn't set up the internet for me. So if you don't have a data package and don't use this service, the phone is great. There is a facebook and myspace app but you can't get on those sites.

Now the phone seems clunky compared to all those cool sleek phones out there, the image quality is nothing amazing, and it only can hold polyphonic ringtones.Bottom line: I would recommend this phone for parents buying kids their first phone. However, this is by no means a good phone for the experienced cell phone user.** Also, get a deal with Cingular or T-Mobile to get this phone for about $20.

The lines should be red and green like on all these flip phones. (Remember, I bought this for an elderly person.

64774978	The specs on the Droid X are impressive, however buying a Motorola phone has become a terrible idea with their current trends.  Motorola has delayed updates to their current phones multiple times (Motorola Cliq users are up in arms as I type this since Motorola is the ONLY Android phone manufacturer that this has phones operating Android 1.5.  See [...] for more info).On top of poor support Motorola is locking capabilities out of their phones to prevent the owners of said phones from upgrading the phones themselves (as of right now Motorola is the only Android manufacturer to do this).The Droid X is a pretty nice phone when you look at the specs, but it is by no means a top of the line phone.  Phones like the HTC Evo, the Nexus One, and Samsung's new Vibrant line are all better alternatives when you look at nothing more than phone specs.  Add in Motorola's continued degradation in service and you're simply looking at purchasing a future headache in the Droid X. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 13:36:54	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65425707	I started with Virgin as my first cell provider when I was in high school and have been with them for about 8 years now. Service has improved as has coverage and they have always provided a reasonable value for their product, especially compared with 2-year plan larger service providers such as Verizon and Virgin's parent company, Sprint Nextel. I have been through a number of phones throughout the years, most operating fine with an issue here or there, typically resolved with little difficulty. About a year ago Virgin go into the smartphone game aggressively, unveiling the Moto Triumph. Excited, I purchased it as a present to myself in November and enjoyed the product for about 8 or 9 months. By and large it worked well, though there were some software issues, especially with storage and GPS location, that have all been well documented on the web. By now, I am sure it's well understood what the pros and cons of this phone are. What people do need to consider is what happens when the phone begins to fail. From what I have seen around the web, the issue of the soldering on the charging port at the base of the phone has been poorly engineered. Consequently, after a certain degree of use, it begins to become flaky and phone will have trouble charging. There have also been ongoing issues with batteries unable to hold their charge.Anyways, in July my phone began to experience both issues. I contacted Virgin and they sent me a replacement phone. No problems yet. Then, about three weeks into owning the replacement phone, it began to exhibit the same problems that my old phone had. A week later and it would not turn on. Another replacement was sent. This time, when I received the phone, it would not turn on at all. Very frustrated, I wrote Virgin how upset I was. They immediately sent out a replacement battery and charger. A few days ago I received those, swapped everything out, tried the phone, and still nothing. It's clear that Virgin is dealing with a mass failing of this particular phone. Worse, their solution is to simply swap broken phones among customers until their 1-year warranty and they are left up s*** creek with no paddle. Of course, I contacted them again, very frustrated. They told me they would deal with this immediately.A few days passed, then I asked them what was going on - I had been paying for service now for the better part of the month without actually having a phone. They told me they could not send me another replacement (which I expressed concern about being just another dud, to which they dismissed my issues) until they had received my previous phone (that had been replaced with the phone which would not turn at all). I had sent that back a few days before. I explained how ridiculous this all was, considering I as the customer was sitting with my thumb up my a** waiting for all variety of broken phones to be flown back and forth across the country to kill time for their corporate regulatory purposes. Even better, my demands that I be recompensed for all these days of service I was paying for and not receiving was largely dismissed. Now, they have called my childhood home (I guess that was my additional phone number back in the days when I lived at home in high school 8 years ago) and threatened my parents that they would cancel service to my phone because I had failed to return a replaced device.Go ahead, Virgin, cut off access from a phone that won't even turn on, which was sent by your refurb department to layover a previously shuffled dysfunctional device. At this point, they have not only insulted me a stunning number of times, but also taken me for granted, and indicated that they think their customers (such as me) are fools and will fall for this phone shuffle. There is little they could possibly due to remedy this behavior and I have made it my duty to invest the time to relay this story and warn other prospective customers in as many forums of report as possible.

79678229	I have been using Lumia 920 for a month now. This is the best phone ever. I was an iPhone user and did not find any inconvenience of switching. Many people complain about number of Apps. But I do not find that is the problem for me. I frequently use Nokia Map, Nokia Drive (still in beta), some games (Black Jack). They are all good Apps. So far, no rebooting. WP8 is very fast and I got job done.Camera is superb and better than my Cannon. We just came back from a Cruise trip from Bahamas and use my phone shot many videos.There is a learning curve though. But regular users should pick up within two weeks. Trust me, if I can learn how to use it, everybody can.Price is a steal. You will never get this price for the next version because both hardware and software are maturing.

I bought this from a just launched seller, and tried to return it because it was not as advertised.

64219326	After 3.5 yrs I decided to move out of Apple iPhone. I would suggest this phone if u r a first time Android or Smartphone user. Thanks to good battery life, bright screen, 5.2 big screen, double tap unlock, especially thinner bezel, fastest processor(seriously awesome), single click Camera open (from long press down button), one would love this phone.If you arent worried abt No Sd lot (only 32 gb internal) and back side buttons(which I liked it as an alternative for side buttons bcoz in any way u will have a finger at the back while holding it),  I would suggest this phone.Drawback: The only drawback I could see is: Using back buttons to reduce the volume while video is streaming. I hope there should be an alternative for this. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 13:43:17	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66087177	I had a Samsung Propel, but lost it in December.  I needed a new phone with a qwerty keypad, and the LG Neon seemed like a great bargain.  You can go to your local Wal-Mart and pick this thing up for less than $100, pop in a sim card, and you're ready to go.  Sounds great, right?  But after a few weeks, problems began to emerge.I bought this because I don't need many features.  All I wanted was a phone with which I could make calls and send texts, and I wanted a qwerty keypad.  This one has a somewhat pleasing design, with buttons spaced out nicely.  It also has a touchscreen, but you can only use that to dial numbers, so it's really more of an afterthought.  The Neon seemed to perform just fine for what I needed it to do, at first.  Then I started noticing the problems.It's horribly slow.  For example; you get a text, you slide the phone open to view it, wait about 2 seconds before you can actually do anything, then you push the button to view the text, and wait about another 2 to 3 seconds for the message to appear on the screen. Everything you do on this phone is like this.  The phone is painfully slow.For some reason, the phone would just turn off from time to time.  Not just when it was in my pocket, but often when it was just sitting on a table, with a fully charged battery.  But it should also be noted that this phone is pretty bad about unlocking itself in your pocket.The keypad is a bit frustrating.  It can be really tedious typing punctuations and numbers.  I don't know how to explain this properly, but it's not a problem I've ever had with other phones.  I've just never gotten used to this keypad, and it's such a pain to use numbers and punctuation, that I find myself avoiding typing them whenever possible.In the past week or so, I've been experiencing a new problem: for some reason, when I make a call, I'll dial the number, and then hear silence for about 10 seconds.  Then I hear the person on the other end saying, hello?  hello?  This happens every time I make a call now.  My wife said that she picked up the phone a good 5 seconds before she could hear me talking.  I don't know what that's all about.  I've never had this problem with any other phone, but it was this problem that has finally made me decide to get a new phone.Go to your local att; dealer, and play around with their display model.  You'll notice that it feels cheaply made.  It is, inside and out.  There are much better phones for the same price.  Samsung makes 2 great phones: the Magnet and the Propel, which are both great, reliable, durable, functioning phones.  I got a deal on my Propel back when I renewed my contract, so I don't know its price, but I do know that you can get a Magnet for about the same price as the Neon, and I would strongly advise anyone looking at the Neon to consider the Magnet.  I've just bought a Motorola Karma, which you can get for about $160 brand new if you buy it online.  That's a good bit more that the Neon, but really, almost anything is better.I would recommend reading reviews from people who have owned the Neon for a little while, as opposed to those who just bought one.  My Neon seemed great at first, but quickly became the worst phone I've ever owned.  I almost wrote a really positive review when I first got this thing, but I'm glad I waited, because I would have misinformed people.Bottom line: this is a cheaply made phone, and there are others in this price range that are much better. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 13:45:35	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Enclosure		false

67084115	I had an HTC incredible 2 before this phone and I really liked it. It had some quirks, but overall I liked how that phone worked for me Until it fell in the toilet. I had to have a replacement quickly. The galaxy s4 wasn't out yet and even though I had read the complaints about this phone, I purchased it. The problems started after a few days. Apps were saying that they were no longer running. Audio apps would stop running if I allowed the screen to go dark. The phone's speed seemed to slow down immensely after several days. I would try to type text messages or search the web and after typing 4-5 letters, I would realize nothing was appearing on the screen. A few seconds later the letters would appear. Seems odd for such a powerful processor to be running that slow. The phone seems to have trouble maintaining it's 4g connection. It freezes for a while and after about a minute, it will switch to 3g. This takes way to long in my opinion. In the last 2 weeks, I am starting to develop the sim card issue as well. The only solution I have found for sluggishness and sim car issue is to restart the phone (closing all apps). Then the phone is good for a few days before a restart is needed again.I have had this phone for almost 3 months and don't recommend it to anyone. My brother recently got the S4 and in the few days I have seen it, the S4 puts this phone to shame. I feel that my incredible 2 was almost as powerful as the DNA, that's how poorly the DNA performs for me. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 13:50:40	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false
46426718	I bought this for use in Europe, where I am a student and need a sim capable phone.  The company that sold it and the phone itself are incredible.  I think someone commented earlier that it came from England, I believe they're right because mine also came with a British prong plug, however, a converter is included so it's useable in N. America as well.  The speed is spectacular, the camera is excellent (even in poorly illuminated areas).  To give you an idea, I placed a clear screen protector on the phone and my friend couldn't even tell.  It is pricey, but you'll be very happy for a long time.  It's top of the line, it's fast, I doubt you'll ever need more than 64 gb of memory.  It is microsim, but any phone repair shop can cut it for $5.  The screen is definitely cleaner and clearer than the Samsung S3.  There was one glitch, which happened during an update.  While updating it lost connection to the internet and it got blocked in what I thought was the infamous #34;airplane mode#34; (google it).  However, it was merely a coincidence, I reinstalled Jelly Bean and it runs beautifully.  It's definitely for people with bigger hands, I'm 6'2 and the phone looks normal in my hands, while for other people it's #34;huge#34;.  Also, the audio is excellent, I tested it with beats headphones and it's...it sounds multidimensional, very crisp and clear.  The ear buds you get with it are nothing special, but if you have beats headphones, it's definitely worth it.  Definitely love this phone, highly recommend. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 13:50:40	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65387816	Cellphone coverage in my hilly, rural area is spotty at best, my house is in a dead zone and I didn't want to pay the high monthly costs for a plan and phone from Verizon, ATT or Sprint when I still have to lay out for a landline, too.  Yet I wanted a smartphone for when I'm out and about.  I first upgraded to an LG Optimus V, but it didn't last long after a full immersion in a lake.  This Optimus Elite is a very nice phone for the price, I like it better than the Optimus V, and it appears to be better at capturing a signal. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 13:50:47	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
41274583	This was supposed to be the phone of my dreams.  Everything about it was over hyped by Nokia.  The camera was supposed to be a game changer but it takes average photos at best in the daytime.  Night shots are nice but they have no sharpness.  The screen is actually inferior to the Nokia 820 which I found strange.  The blacks are more greyish and the other colors are washed out.  Battery life is terrible as well.  I could only get about 5 hours out of this phone and if you google it a problem is definitely there.  The front facing camera is mediocre at best.  This model also freezes once in a while.  But hey, at least it's cheap.  I went through three of these phones and have finally given up because they all are really lemons.

Much more substantial than the HTC Desire, prettier in blue, does what you need it to do, fast as the Desire and I have had one which worked fine, but has nothing on the N8. So read the reviews, listen to the detractors if you want, but this is on a par with any of them and far ahead in feel, sturdiness, and the camera...well, no comparison. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 13:55:13	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
66857124	The LG Marquee is a rebranded LG Optimus Black for the Boost Mobile Brand.  Since this phone only runs on the Boost Mobile Network (Sprint) I must divide the phone and service as separate reviews.About Boost Mobile:Customer Support: It took them several days to transfer my old phone number.  The first sales rep created problems with the transfer and it took two days and two other reps to finally get an activated phone.  In the end I did get my phone working with my old phone number but they changed me a $ 15 reactivation charge on a BRAND NEW PHONE (I was not supposed to get this fee).  Since it was so hard to get a hold of a rep I decided to accept the lost as my time is valuable, it's just that Boost Mobile doesn't think my time is valuable :)Actual Phone Service:  In my area (Pittsburgh) I have rarely being without a signal and I have never had a dropped call.  I hear people well and they seem to hear me well too.Texting: Mostly reliable but I have had text messages arrive over an hour after I send them.  It could be an issue on the receiving end but texting has been mostly reliable.Data:  The LG Marquee only runs on the 3G network.  It is not very fast and is nothing special.  My NET10 3G phone had better data speeds but this is like comparing two turtles in a race.  At least the Boost Mobile 3G signal was reliable in my area and rarely do I have problems with streamed audio.About the Phone:Pros -Bright, large screen, really niceSmall, light phoneGood CameraMostly stock Android 2.3.6, little bloatware to talk aboutDecent amount of internal memoryNetflix works with no problems (over Wi-Fi)Flash supportCons-Battery life is short. I use Juice Defender Ultra and I'm lucky to make it to 9 hours of battery life with light phone usage.Slow CPU.  A single core 1000mhz CPU is not going to set the world on fire and this CPU is not very fast.Unresponsive.  This is probably a byproduct of the slow CPU but there are just too many ignored screen/ button presses to not feel like the phone is ignoring you.Price.  This is the biggest con of all.  Boost Mobile sells this phone way to expensive, I got mine on special and with some discounts and I think I still might have overpaid a little.General Impressions about the phone:  I like the phone, it is the fourth Android phone of the family and it is my favorite because of the screen.  I have many chances to charge the phone during the day and have access to Wi-Fi in most of the places I spend my time so many of the cons don't affect me much.  On the other hand if I had to do it all over again I would definitely take a good look at the new G4 phones from Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile.  They cost more but they eliminate most of the cons I have with the LG Marquee. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 13:55:13	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

34215125	I can't say enough good things about the Nokia 920.  I've been very impressed so far.  My last two phones were a Samsung Focus S running Windows Phone 7 which I enjoyed, except for the small amount of good apps compared to iOS and Android.  But Windows Phone 8 is next level -- especially with all the quality apps that are now available.  Software developers are clearly jumping on board now.  Prior to trying the Windows Phone OS I owned an iPhone 3G.  The Windows Phone OS, WP8 in particular, is superior to iOS in so many ways.  It all starts with the user interface.  While iOS and Android use fairly similar desktop based interfaces with icons we've known since the early 90s, Microsoft actually innovated with Windows Phone and created something unique.  While I'm not as excited about the smart tile interface on a large desktop screen; it is excellent on a phone, tablet, or smaller laptop.  The Nokia hardware itself is very impressive.  The phone is responsive and has never crashed on me once -- something I can't say for my iPhone 3GS or Samsung.  My only complaint is the phone does feel a bit heavy - but it also has a very nice camera and the battery life is longer than last two phones (even with the new phone using 4G LTE).  The Nokia build quality definitely feels sturdier than the Samsung I owned.  The Samsung was lighter, but it also felt like cheaper plastic at times.  My other complaint with the Nokia is it doesn't appear the battery can easily be removed/replaced.  Nokia should fix that and not follow the iPhone route with battery access.To me, the bottom line is despite being late to the game, Windows Phone 8 is by far the best mobile phone OS.  Not only that, the 920 is a great value.  I got one for $100 with a 2-yr contract renewal.If you have ATT;, you may want to wait though.  The 920 is awesome, but if you take a lot of photos, Nokia has announced a newer Lumia model with a camera in the 40 megapixel range (sorry I don't have exact number).  It will be by far the best camera in a mobile phone ever.  I've read it will retail for $299 with a 2-yr contract.  The Lumia 920 is still an excellent choice.  It has gotten very good reviews -- PC world gave it 4.5 stars out of 5 -- the same rating they give the iPhone and Galaxy 3.  It may not be the coolest phone right now, but if you aren't a teenager -- try it out and I think you'll be pleased. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 13:55:45	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

This a core part of Nokia's business, and it shows.I've just begun to delve into the camera - so far it certainly is sharp and clear, and can take  shots in very low light - without the fuzz of my previous phone, and high-end point  shoot camera.Windows Phone 8 is so much better than 7 / 7.5 (which was really good) - added functions and customize-ability is better than anything else out there - Some apps still need to catch up - Live Tiles just need the imagination and code from a good programmer and add so much to what the phone can do. The apps that use them well make notification, updates, and status so easy.Oh, and the wireless charging pad really makes it easy to keep the phone charged at my desk - just by setting it down between uses. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 13:59:28	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64653386	I upgraded to the Nexus 5 from a Nexus S 4G. An issue I had with my previous phone was how underpowered it was. After two years' worth of Android system updates, my old phone was pretty slow. A major problem with the Nexus S was the partitioning of the storage space into 2GB and 14GB divisions, which compounded the speed problem with memory issues as well. The Nexus 5 does not have either of these problems because of the new multi-core processor inside, and the entire 16GB of storage space is a single partition and accessible for both installation of apps and storage of photos, etc.The Nexus 5 is very slim and sleek, but many of the cases available for it square off the slightly rounded edges of the phone in addition to adding thickness to the phone, making it a little chunky. This may be a reasonable trade-off if a case prevents your screen of becoming damaged when your phone is dropped.The screen on the Nexus 5 is large and bright. You may want to turn the brightness setting down to conserve battery life, as the screen is responsible for as much as a third of my total battery consumption over the course of the day. With respect to the physical size of the phone, using it one-handed could be difficult if you have small hands. I wear medium/large size gloves, and have no problem with this. The large screen certainly helps with typing using the on-screen keyboard. Far fewer missed keys compared to my older phone.I bought this phone on/around Cyber Monday, so it was on sale for $35 on Amazon for a device upgrade with Sprint. The price may have changed since then. If you're looking to buy the phone off-contract, the Google Play store may be a better deal.When upgrading my phone, I was also considering the HTC One and the Moto X, which are both also great phones. I decided to go with the Nexus 5 because I prefer to run an Android phone without additional manufacturer-specific skins on top. These skins often add features or visual effects I don't use but will still consume system resources. Additionally, the Nexus 5 has a high repairability score from iFixit, which is also important to me. If a part of the phone breaks, I'd rather replace the broken part than buy a whole new phone. The Moto X also has a high repairability score, but the HTC One is not really repairable at all. Another advantage of the Nexus devices are the speed with which they receive Android system updates. You can read more about that elsewhere. Specific to the Nexus 5, the camera software was not particularly good upon launch of the phone in November. By the time I purchased and activated my phone in December, a new system update had been issued, and the camera software was upgraded in that release. The photos taken with the Nexus 5 rival those taken with my friend's iPhone 5, if that is a concern for you. I don't have a comparison to the iPhone 5S. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 13:59:28	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Settings	Software		false

66927982	The Hardware==============Call Quality - Excellent (Typical of all Nokia Phones)The Build Quality - Excellent (Typical of all Nokia Phones)The screen - Good, vibrant, scratch resistant and repels facial grease, IS NOT GORILLA GLASS and is noticeably more fragile.Loudspeaker - A little on the soft sideThe Software==============I have been an avid Windows user since Windows 98, and a Windows Phone user since Windows Phone 7.Windows over the years has gotten more capable and much faster with time. Windows XP to Vista was a little buggy but it worked. Windows Vista to 7 was just a case of slothering Vista in butter and polishing it up to a fine sheen.Windows Phone 7 to Windows Phone 8 has been the experience nightmares are made of. It was basically going from Windows 7 to Windows 95.Windows Phone 7 was an elegant experience for me minus some minor quirks here and there. The most noticeable one was the inability to assign more than one mobile number to any one contact which was rather odd. Others were like not being able to multiselect files or difficulty putting ringtones and audiobooks on the device.They weren't deal breakers and there were some workarounds. That said, everything else in the OS was fully functional. The phones available has very limited storage, most maxing out at 16gbs. However as many figured out, the 1st generation WP7 devices uses MicroSD cards in place of soldered in onboard memory and with a little trick and the right SD Card, could take a 8gb phone and transform it into a 32gb phone. I did it with no problems on my 8gb Dell Venue Pro. Even better, integration with the Zune Desktop Software (ZDS) made syncing music, pictures, podcasts and videos to a lesser extent, a breeze.When i got home, I put my phone to charge, it would ping my desktop wirelessly, fire up the ZDS and start syncing my new podcasts and music automatically to my phone. When I left for work the next morning, everything just worked.Window Phone 8 is nothing like that. With this new OS, expandable storage is natively supported except on my Lumia 820 it doesn't work at all. When i put in my Sandisk 64gb MicroSDXC card, and fired up Windows Media Player to Sync my playlists as I did with my Zune and Windows Phones on the ZDS. (I did this with my old sandisk E250 player back in the PlayForSure days as well)My first thought, Wow this is slow!!Second thought, why is song taking to long to transfer?10 minutes later why is the same song still transferring30 minutes later oh *uck it frozeThen something that never happened on my WP7 Dell Venue Pro happened, my Music and Video app crashed, so did my settings app. On shutting it down, it was permanently frozen on the goodbye screen.I forced restarted it by removing the battery.When i powered it up, the SD Card was missing... I turned off the phone, removed the card and put it back in, powered the phone on and it was still missing. I took the card out and put it in a card reader on the PC. The disc check utility detected an inconsistency on the Card and ran but found no errors. Once it was back in the phone, the phone saw it once more. I tried syncing a playlist again, it transferred on playlist and froze in the middle of another.This happened over and over. Then I quick formatted the card back in exfat on my PC and tried syncing playlists directly to the card without the phone between them. Every song synced perfectly.Once back in my phone, all the songs turned up but... for some odd reason, some songs would turn up with no artist or album information. If i resynced them, or copied them manually, they would then show with the correct info, but then other songs would start doing the same thing, to no fault of the songs themselves because they all worked fine on my Zunes and DVP.Using explorer to drag and drop lots of small numerous files, music and pics mainly, always results in some sort of freezing during copying.In the end I gave up although I was able to do some podcast subscriptions directly on my phone by changing my country to USA so I could have some sort of entertainment on my phone for when I was driving or waiting in line. This is still a problem because when I want to view podcasts on my TV or desktop while I work with my nice sounding speakers... I can't.Over the last 2 days something else has started happening which is doubly annoying. For some odd reason, my music videos and pictures have started duplicating and triplicating themselves.If i plug in the phone and navigate to the directory, there is only one physical file even thought the phone sees 2 or 3 of them.Whats worse is if I delete even one of the duplicates, all of the duplicates including the original are deleted.The Nokia Lumia 820 is a horrible phone===========================================This is coming from someone who has owned only Nokia phones his whole life aside for a Dell Venue Pro and an Ericsson and has been a massive fan of Microsoft's Zune Software and Hardware devices as well as the Windows Phone 7 line of devices.NOTHING works like it ought to and despite how much I loved WP7, I cannot recommend this phone to anyone out there.I cannot even return it for a refund because it was bought in the USA and I live in Trinidad and Tobago.If other Windows Phone 8 handsets give the same problem as this Lumia 820, I recommend avoiding them until Microsoft and the OEM's get their house in order and fix what was not broken in Windows Phone 7.5 to begin with. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 14:01:13	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false
55725667	I've had my Windows Phone 8X since just after Thanksgiving. I was really excited to get it because it was so much lighter than the Lumia 920, and just felt better in my hand.My initial impression is that the phone feels _tall_. I put it side by side with an iPhone 5 and it's actually just barely taller, which makes me think it's just the narrowness of it relative to all the Nokias that makes it look so tall.  The only downside to the height is that the lock screen button is still on the top right corner, so it can be a bit far to reach.The body is a lovely soft touch coating, in a color I have affectionately named 'blurple', but HTC calls 'California Blue'.  I love when a manufacturer takes the extra initiative, and having the matching earpiece color and even the OS color is really impressive.  My only real complaints are that the buttons are so subtle along the sides that it can sometimes be hard to really push them- especially the lock screen which can be a bit of a reach for small hands.Inside, the 8X is blessed by pretty much the best Qualcomm hardware on the market.  It's wicked fast, never lags, and the OS is gorgeous when rendered on the vivid LCD screen.The only real reasons I've taken away a star are: high-ish price (with a Lumia 920 32gb running just 99, it's hard to compete), the hard to push lock button, and the fact that the soft touch on my corners has begun to wear down a little bit.I think this is a fantastic phone that you'd be much happier owning than literally ANY Android phone on the market. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 14:01:13	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Enclosure		false
66972351	I bought an LG Volt and side by side compared it to the Samsung S3.The Volt does everything pretty well, although there was some intermittent glitchiness in the GPS that I noticed.The battery life claims are no joke.  Using it heavily for testing purposes, I still had about 65% battery left after 12 hours of use.It feels a bit clunkier and cheaper than the S3, but neither one of them would be mistaken for an iphone, and besides, this is a value phone on a value carrier, so no razzle-dazzle is expected.The comparison came to an end when I realized that the Volt I'd bought wouldn't connect to the local LTE coverage from Sprint.  Virgin Mobile reps insisted that this was because LTE isn't offered in my area, but the S3 connected just fine and got me 20-25 mbps of download speed compared to just 1 mbps on the Volt using their 3g network.The screen is pretty plain, but it's perfectly adequate, and it has slightly better outdoor visibility than the S3, owing to the different screen technology between the two devices.  The S3 has a super-amoled screen and the Volt has an IPS screen, I believe.This is a good workhorse, no-frills type of smartphone, but make sure that your area has Sprint 4g LTE coverage, or else it won't really be worth upgrading to this device from an older smartphone. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 14:03:36	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

22240281	The phone is so-so when working, but break easily.  Nokia Tech Support is terrible.  ATT is Terrible.  What else can i say?Windows Phone 8 has great potential but lacks the polish that other mature opperating systems have.  The apps are lacking still, and the ones they do have are generally beta versions riddled with bugs, that will just cause you annoyance.  All of the Face Book apps are poor, amazon instant video doesn't exist, Dropbox doesn't have an official app, roboform has not app, etc.  Save frustration, keep with Apple or Google.VERY UNHAPPY I UPGRADED TO A NOKIA FROM IPHONE. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 14:03:36	Compliment	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false
85153628	Had to return the phone. There are quite a number of major flaws that are not acceptable for 2013 smartphone's standards. BATTERY LIFE IS HORRIBLE. Nokia packed so much tech, and a huge battery but that still didn't help. A lot of headphones with built-in mic don't work. Volume sometimes works only for music and not for phone ringtone, and vise versa. Still no Apps. LTE works like crap on ATT;, and I only had 9Mbs down while my friends iPhone 5 on ATT; same LTE was getting close to 22MBs!!! Nokia maps and Bing integration just blows more than Apple's Maps fiasco. I searched for a club that was 2 blocks away from me, the phone found another club, 5 miles away with different name. For a smartphone, it's quite dumb. Micro USB cable charges fast only if you use the one that came with the phone, which is BS. Typing is not faster than iPhone and way behind than Android Jelly Bean keyboard. Voice commands sound more like a gimmick and had no real use for me, maybe for someone who's blind or disabled, even then it doesn't understand what you tell the phone to do.Microsoft is loosing the game quite badly, come on. Software company with so much development and research can figure these things out. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 14:05:23	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

66310914	Ordered 8/31/2013 via Moto-maker.  Received a phone call two days later stating I should call them to clear up an activation issue.  When I called, representatives could not figure out what was wrong with the order and kept transferring me to different departments.  After two days of phone calls that they initiated one rep finally seemed to resolve the issue.  Then as the est delivery date approached, I noticed my phone was still not shipped.  I called to make sure everything was ok with order.  Rep changed the shipment date three times after I questioned him on his promised delivery days... I do no think the reps are well trained.  They have generally been unhelpful.  They are pleasant to the point of being annoying; constantly marketing scripts about how Motorola wants to make sure customers have a great experience.I tried to cancel the order but they would not allow me to cancel so close to shipment date...wow what an annoying experience!Hopefully will receive phone sometime in the near future and be able to amend the rating after finding the amazing utility this phone potentially has!Addendum 9/7/2013A pleasant surprise.  I received the phone today 9/7/2103 (initially ordered 8/31/2013).  Not too bad.  Rep on phone claimed that deliveries were not made on Saturdays.  I guess they were wrong about something else again.  I am happy to have received the phone in a timely manner despite the customer service frustrations.  I am amending my initial rating and will update rating after using the phone for a while.Addendum 9/10/2013After using phone for a few days it is pretty much everything I expected.  Very good feeling phone.  Takes a little getting used to the smaller the screen but nice to have a smaller form factor again (I am coming from a note 2 and have previously owned an iphone4, incredible 2, evo4g, blackberry bold, iphone 3gs).  The always on/hands free functions work well and is one of the things that puts this phone above all the others.  Below is a summary of my thoughts.Pros:1. Customizatble: Motomaker website is nice and allows personalization that is not available anywhere else.  Good choices and it is fun making a personal phone!2. Form factor: 4.7 inches is a great form factor for me.  I do not watch a ton of videos and do not play a ton of games.  I mostly do emails, text, read news, and use apps like maps, epocrates etc.  I play games once in a while and do watch some videos but this is a perfect size for me.  I like the portability of the phone and the shape  weight.  It feels great.  In fact I would say it is the best feeling phone I have ever used in terms of holding and carrying it.3. Battery Life:  Excellent.  Gets me through a day of use in a small form factor.  Nicely done.4. Processor: Good enough.  Gets choppy when I use lots of apps serially but I expect that.  Only time will tell if the processors are good enough to future proof this phone.  But I think it will hold up pretty well.5. Software:  Motorola really has done something very different and practical with their version of android here.  Handsfree works well for me.  I especially appreciate it when I am driving.  But I actually find myself using it more than I thought I would.  I even use it sometimes when I am just sitting around.  The skin is light which I really like also.  Camera gesture is awesome and I have found myself using the camera more these past few days.  If this keeps up this phone is worth it just for these reasons...I use the functions on the phone more!  If I take more pics and use the functions of the phone more then that pretty much makes the case for me to buy this phone vs others just on that fact alone.  Notifications are also second to none.  I can see messages pending to be read without having to touch any buttons when I pick the phone up.  Something as simple as that is a great feature.6. Voice phone calls clear and signal strength good.Cons:1. For me Moto maker is one of the factors that make this phone distinctive.  So although personalization is a pro the service failed horribly because of the customer service.  I almost did not get the phone because of the moto maker experience.  Actually I was almost not able to get the phone because of the customer service...After ordering the phone, waiting about a week to get it, going through torture during that week to make sure I got it, and then using it for about 4 days, I have to say I would recommend this phone.  Great feeling and looking phone while being very functional.  Minus one star for horrible moto maker experience because of customer service. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 14:10:11	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

69096472	So, to start, I am on my 3rd Nexus 4 phone which was my 2rd replacement phone. I had issues with all of them and wish I had the opportunity to go back in time and return it before agreeing to multiple returns which put me past my 15 day return policy. So advice to anyone that has problems with there Google product... return it and don't agree to an exchange! I should also note that I am, or at least was, a very happy nexus 7 owner until my difficulties with the 4 have changed my opinion on the nexus products and Google themselves. I figured the company with the slogan #34;don't be evil#34; would understand my difficulties and frustration, since they are noted on my account, and would have helped me get a nexus 5 with some sort of deal, since I have had all these troubles or at least come up with some practical alternative that would help me get a working phone.... I should back up at this point and note that my nexus 4 is just about as useful as a brick at this point and I am stuck shopping for a new phone after only 8 months of ownership.I know a few other people with this phone and some would say that it is a great phone and I would have agreed with them it mine worked as well as my N7 tablet. My 1 star rating has to deal with this product as much as the Google costumer. I hope this helps future buyers of Google products! If a rep. from Google reads this, I would like them to know that as much as I hate it, I will be going to apple for my next phone...

54932372	I often get compliments and questions whenever someone sees this phone for the first time.  If a phone can look luxurious, then this one does.  Smooth Gorilla glass from edge to edge, nice color accents and an all around good feel to this phone.  No plastic like the Galaxy S3 or Galaxy S4.  The physical specs are top notch with the exception of memory and battery, which are well documented.  Using the Qi charger prevents battery life being much of a problem for me.  When not using it, I set it down on the charging pad.  Not really a hassle when you don't have to plug and unplug a tiny microUSB connection all the time.I bought this phone because it had a 5 FULL HD 16:9  screen.  Perfect for watching movies right?  Well, just like most HTC phones, this phone is NOT COMPATIBLE with Ultra Violet movie downloads through Flixster.  So all those Blu-Ray movies that I bought, thinking I would be able to watch the Ultra Violet version on a plane, are relagated to my living room.  Ultra Violet had to potential of making my Android phone just as versatile as iPhone's Digital Copy that comes with many Blu-Ray movies.I use PogoPlugPogoplug Series 4 Backup Device [Newest Version]for my storage needs, so the lack of storage is not as big of a deal for me as it is for others.  The Qi takes care of the battery issue for me.  So if you don't need the Ultra Violet movies, this could be a GREAT phone for you, but I would not have bought it if I knew it wouldn't work with Flixster downloads.As a side note, you CAN STREAM Ultra Violet movies using the Flixster app, just not dowload them for offline viewing.UPDATE:  Ultraviolet movies can now be downloaded using Best Buy's Cinemanow app when linked to your ultraviolet account.  HOWEVER, playback is sketchy at best.  Try to play it a half dozen times and maybe the movie will start on one of your tries.  When it does work, it is not HD.Oh yeah... Forgot to mention the first time around.  Not sure if this is common with the DNA, but mine never seems to remember preferences when I tell it to ALWAYS associate an app with a function.  For example, every time an app (even the People contacts app that comes with the phone) links to navigation, I have to choose Google Maps instead of Verizon's preloaded bloat ware. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 14:21:10	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

69096472	So, to start, I am on my 3rd Nexus 4 phone which was my 2rd replacement phone. I had issues with all of them and wish I had the opportunity to go back in time and return it before agreeing to multiple returns which put me past my 15 day return policy. So advice to anyone that has problems with there Google product... return it and don't agree to an exchange! I should also note that I am, or at least was, a very happy nexus 7 owner until my difficulties with the 4 have changed my opinion on the nexus products and Google themselves. I figured the company with the slogan #34;don't be evil#34; would understand my difficulties and frustration, since they are noted on my account, and would have helped me get a nexus 5 with some sort of deal, since I have had all these troubles or at least come up with some practical alternative that would help me get a working phone.... I should back up at this point and note that my nexus 4 is just about as useful as a brick at this point and I am stuck shopping for a new phone after only 8 months of ownership.I know a few other people with this phone and some would say that it is a great phone and I would have agreed with them it mine worked as well as my N7 tablet. My 1 star rating has to deal with this product as much as the Google costumer. I hope this helps future buyers of Google products! If a rep. from Google reads this, I would like them to know that as much as I hate it, I will be going to apple for my next phone... At least with them, I know they make a reliable product! 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 14:21:25	Complaint	No Defect	No Defect	Replacement	No Defect	No Defect		false
66327190	We got this phone for use in Europe with an international SIM card.  The phone worked great with the SIM card and we were able to receive calls everyone in Europe.  It has the quad frequency required by most countries.  Call clarity was good and the camera takes good pictures.  It has many apps already installed - most of them are nice to have but not necessary.  We did not use data much in Europe as we were on a cruise and spent time in London using Tube and Bus.  Everything is pretty well marked so GPS and other nice apps were not required.  The phone has many options and you can make it a secure as you desire.  It is small enough to fit snugly is most any pocket.  I was concerned about the size because of some previous comments.  I found it large enough to use with my big hands but yet compact enough to secure it against possible theft.  I also have to say it worked very well with my hearing aid - something that not all phones do well.  I am very happy with the phone and plan to use it when we travel later this year.  We also use it to call Sri Lanka from the US because the call quality is great and the rates with our SIM are better than our local phone or our US cell phone with ATT. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 14:21:25	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66946180	I've been using the phone for over a month, mostly using Wi-Fi for internet and application downloads.  It connects automatically at home to my network. I have not connected to other hotspots, but I see a listing when they are available, but just don't which ones do not require a password pin.  Wish it automatically found the unsecured hotspots for me.  I love all the wealth of Microsoft apps available and most work with this phone.The touch screen is great.  This is the first phone I've owned with it.  Nice to navigate and play games.  The apps like MS MyPhone and Sprite work automatically to backup the phone data.  And Valuephone has three great apps that sync with the computer to keep pins/passwords, addresses, and even grocery and other lists current between up to three phone with that app installed.  The addresses port automatically from the phone's Window's Live synced addressbook and MS Office Outlook.  Office is installed and nice, as is Windows Media.  Absolutely no problem sending pictures to different internet sites, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  You can even check Card and Bank balances, as well as email from other POP accounts.  Everything works seemlessly, fast, and efficiently.The camera is adequate and video quality nominal.  Audio books play fine using Overdrive and sync to the PC Overdrive console.  And it only costs a few dollars a month for the occasional phone calls and texts.  I recommend using Google Voice to save some texting money.  It still displays on the phone when you use the google voice phone number.The browsers are good.  Skyfire shows more details but is a little harder to use than IE, yet has some functions IE doesn't.  Facebook app requires you to relog in to your account to get back to current, refresh does not do that like it should.  Twitter is current, however, as soon as it appears.  A nice addition to the pocket. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 14:25:18	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65868367	I agree with Lisa on her review. This phone down right sucks! I got this phone new in April and have had it replaced 3 times since then. And will be making another trip to Verizon tomorrow. Everytime they give me another phone(the enV) it just does the same thing as the last one. And the calibration is useless; you try to touch the 9 and it gives you a 6. You try to type an s and it gives you an I. Everything about this phone is frustrating and useless. I have never in my life had such an awful phone.

66364549	i'm going to be short with my review, just going to list the things I didn't like about the phone.1. There was a bug where the phone's screen would show a LOT of pixelation when it's viewing something very dark. Basically you'll see black and dark gray squares everywhere. It should be a software issue, but it annoyed me a lot.2. price, i just couldn't justify owning a $600 phone.3. the s-pen is really useless unless you play draw something a lot.4. when holding the phone for long periods of time (youtube videos), my hands get really tired if you grip it with one hand. for me, i like whipping my phone out at times with one hand to check some stuff out quickly, this phone is NOT meant to do that. ideally it must be held with both hands, which really limits multitasking.5. there is a very noticeable shutter lag in its camera.6. slow update to ICS, still not out as far as I know.7. plastic design, don't know why samsung loves plastic that much.i'm not hating on the phone, I think it's a great phone, but just not for me. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 14:25:46	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

29947070	This phone is awesome! Especially for it's price.I got it at tmobile for $550!I originally wanted to get a Samsung galaxy 3 but the employee suggested I try this phone since it was around the same price. I was kind of disappointed since this phone does not have a microSD slot but with great quality it didn't really matter to me anymore.The performance is super smooth even though there's a lot of apps. I haven't had any issues with it for the last 1  years that I've had it.The grip around the edges is really nice considering the glass can get slippery.I also enjoy getting system updates since when I originally bought the phone it was jellybean but it has upgraded to kitkat.I think I care for my things better than most people my age so I don't understand how people break their screens- if your clumsy, I suggest you buy a protective case :) 	jwilets	10-26-2015 14:25:46	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
89832273	Don't be deceived, this product is NOT as described. I9300 is #34;SPY CAMERA#34; brand. It says #34;White#34; and it arrived Black. 1st battery was charged, and I switched out to the second battery to charge it, and it required the whole phone to be reset. Lost the time/date. How long has it been since you ever had to set the time/date on a phone? The screen locks up when it #34;sleeps#34; and requires several power down selections before it #34;behaves#34; properly. I am very dissatisfied with this purchase. It also describes the phone is in English, and that was also not true. Very difficult to navigate to settings and change to English when you don't even know what you are reading in a foreign language.

45626309	This is my 2nd review and I dislike this phone more than my previous review a few months ago. I have had this phone since April 1st and it has slowly performed worse as the days go bye. I now have sim card errors every other day, if not sooner. I think it has something to do with the phone's reception/antenna. When this happens, the phone always says I have no network data connection. Never had this problem with any other phone. The 4g connection is good about half the time. The other half, you don't know what is going on and the phone takes forever to switch to 3g or lower. You can use the phone one minute and the next the sim card error appears. Last night I was no more than 200 yds in clear view of a cell tower, and the phone would not work. Then sim card error appears and no data connection. Every time this happens, I have to restart the phone and then, magically, nothing out of the ordinary.Battery life is about 4 hrs of continuous use. The processor can be really slow. Again, there seems to be no reason when this occurs, it just does. My 3g HTC operated faster than this one now does.There's no real help for this phone and it was out of date when I bought it, 4 months after its release. I would not recommend this phone even for free!! Go with some other brand. I used to love HTC, but now I don't think I will buy another. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 14:29:33	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

I expected to settle for it and find it useable but I'm surprised how nice it is. The UI is pleasing to look at and very very responsive - I don't miss Jelly Bean and its project butter. It's well rounded and I'm a bit disappointed with some reviews it's getting from CNET and other sites because it doesn't have an advertising campaign with it or catchy features that hardly get used (like on the S3-which is still a great phone!)I came from an HTC Rezound which I liked a lot, but the bigger screen and thinner body of the Spectrum 2 make this a VERY nice upgrade. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 14:30:27	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

If you use car charger and have GPS on, the battery gets so hot you can't hold the phone or have it in your lap while driving. The battery, even when charging, cannot keep up with the current drain used by the GPS application. So the phone dies after 1.5-2 hours. Terrible, terrible service.

1700624	I purchased a phone from this company. Worst mistake ever! When I removed the phone from the box and turned it on, the screen came alive in Arabic. The charger was for use in Europe, not North America. There was no contact information in the box or the invoice so I looked up the company on Google. Their website gave a phone number which I called. The guy who answered the phone was less than helpful and told me to contact Amazon. I called Amazon, they told me to contact the seller. There I sat with an Arabic phone that I had no idea what to do with. I called Nokia. There tech took almost an hour to solve the problem and then it was more luck than skill. Finally changed the language to English and proceeded to setup the phone and then remove all of the Arabic apps and links. The phone worked fine for three days and then started freezing up. Again less than no help from the seller. I am returning the phone to them and have purchased a replacement from another seller through Amazon. Only being a good Amazon customer has saved this bad experience. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 14:31:50	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

When I took to this to Cingular, they asked me to get a Nokia because that has a very good reception.So in a nutshell, I was bowled over by its looks when I bought it but next phone will definitely be Nokia. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 14:33:33	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	Other	Hardware	Ports	new charger did not help	false

60241157	If you are in the market for a smart phone and are not bound to Apple or Google's ecosystems, Windows Phone 8 and the Nokia Lumia 920 is a great choice.The operating system:  Love the live tiles.  Many features (e.g. Facebook) are tightly integrated with the OS itself.  I would not be happy going back now that I am used to many of these features.The hardware:  Rock solid.  I came from an iPhone 3GS.  I regularly used an iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 from my family and co-workers.  The iPhones are getting 'prettier', but when your new iPhone takes a tumble, there's a good chance you will end up with some pretty cracks.  The Lumia 920 reminds me of the old iPhone 3GS - sure, it's a bit heavier than other phones, but this is more than justified by the durability.  I personally enjoy a solid device device with enough heft to know you have it in your hand or pocket - I see the weight as a neutral or positive, particularly over the iPhone 5, which is too light IMHO.The screen:  Arguably the best or one of the best out there in the North American market.  The iPhone feels tiny in comparison.The camera:  Excellent.  Great manual controls, the best low-light performance you can get in a phone.  Rivals any other phone camera out there.  The automatic controls seem to have a little trouble in bright light, I suspect this will be resolved in an update.The app ecosystem:  Decent.  This is the one sore spot - certain apps aren't available for the Windows Phone 8 OS yet.  Fortunately, it isn't set in stone; with brisk sales and an easy path to port applications from Windows 8, this will be changing quickly.  I haven't run into any show stoppers - you can find comparable apps for the most part.  On the plus side, tight integration with Microsoft software (SkyDrive integration, OneNote, etc.) is a huge help, and Nokia's fantastic apps (e.g. Drive) set it apart from other Windows 8 phones.On the whole,  I would recommend this phone to anyone looking to pick up a smart phone who isn't deeply tied to Apple iOS or Google Android ecosystems.  I will not be going back to iOS. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 14:35:59	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66765824	AVOID BUYING ANYTHING FROM MOBILE BEST SELLERS  as they are either vary careless or worse.  I ordered two GT-E1182L phones to take to Mexico so that my wife and I in Mexico could get Sim cards and keep in touch while on our trip.I bought SIM cards in Mexico, but the phones would not work.  The reason is that we were shipped GT-E1182 (no L at the end) phones.  There are NOT quad-band but duo band phones.  The shipper, Mobile Best Sellers put a sticker on the box giving the model as GT-E1182L, but taking the battery out and using a magnifying glass on the writing in the phone under where the battery sits, one can see there is no #34;L#34; at the end of the model number.  It was most distressing!

Not sure I'm sold on Android but the only better thing is the option to add an SD card to these phones. Too many different things the app makers have to deal with to make sure their app will work well with your phone. I have one large app (Audobon Birds Pro) that I can't seem to move to external sd card but I think I should be able to. But if you don't have much memory on the phone itself it seems to be a heck of a lot slower.Low price + sd card = one good deal 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 14:38:32	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

66493480	I bought a windows phone this week and I must say that I was literally amazed by its speed and its touch and feel due to the rubber back that allows you to grip it very well. I took the black and white version that I liked much more than the blue.  I was amazed by its simplicity and above all for its cleanliness installing the application and then how easy you find them again, I really like the system to tiles that is much better on a mobile phone on a PC. The battery lasts more than a day with intensive use with push notifications and wifi always on. The only drawback may be the only 4 GB of storage space although for photos videos and music you can use a sd card. For me this thing is not a big problem, since I don't use maps or play with games. I installed eighty applications and space is almost full, but for what I need is really fantastic. In my opinion much better in terms of use of any Android. I'm really super satisfied. And last thing when you hear the music in the headphones is really another music thanks to Beats Audio. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 14:39:52	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66089462	The LT15A Xperia Arc (Anzu) is simply amazing, this 1GHz single core processor holds its own against many of the current dual cores out there, even beating the SG SII in some areas. Its construction feels rock solid, and there are plenty of after market cases, accessories and mods on the internet for very cheap.There is however some bad news, the stock Sony apps and Sony bloatware weigh the handset down immensely. Your apps, the ones you actually want to run, are constantly competing for system resources with the stock Sony apps which are constantly running in the background, needlessly hogging resources and gobbling up precious battery life. The Sony apps for the most part are not removable, and insist on residing in the tiny phone memory as opposed to the massive SD card, making life a constant battle to keep enough room free for daily operations.Luckily there is also some good news, there is a replacement Android firmware called Cyanogenmod that is offered for free. Cyanogenmod replaces the stock Sony Android system, allowing you total control over the apps and many other previously restricted customization features. The catch is that you must unlock the handset's bootloader, thus voiding the warranty from the manufacturer. If you plan to do this, it is a good idea to wait a few months at least until you're reasonable satisfied you didn't receive a lemon. It is also recommended that you have a moderate level of technical expertise to perform this operation, as if not you may end up rendering your handset inoperable while in the process of voiding your warranty.I literally hated this handset until I removed the Sony software, the Sony apps were so intrusive, obnoxious and persistent, it made me want to chuck it out the window on more than one occasion. After installing Cyanogenmod, the Arc went from being a mediocre and mildly frustrating smartphone to full fledged superphone. Apps that used to take thirty seconds to open now take ten. There is so much space on the internal handset memory I can load it up with all my most frequently used programs for faster access. The battery lasts many hours longer on standby, and can now sustain heavy internet use all day instead of just half a day as it did before.To sum it all up, if you're someone who isn't interested in heavy customization and just wants a smartphone that works smoothly out of the box, buy an iPhone or a BB. However if you are someone who is interested in a pocket sized supercomputer and doesn't mind a bit of hassle to get it up and running properly, the Xperia Arc is an excellent choice. 	tokiwong	10-26-2015 14:39:52	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	Upgrade	Operating System	Software		false
20552300	This is my 3rd Casio phone.  Originally, I had the Rock, which was great, and lasted 4 years before falling to puppy teeth.  My 2nd phone was the Commando (3G Version), which was my first smart phone ever, and I HATED.  Poor specs, too much bloatware, and I hated the touch screen.  So I decided to try the Ravine 2.It's pretty good.  It is water resistant, and I like the buttons better than on the Rock.  I also like the LCD screen on the outside of the phone, which seems more burn-in resistant than the Rock.  It also has a pretty decent browser for a dumb phone (Opera web browser), and decent voice recognition softwareThat being said, the battery life on this phone is abysmal compared to the Rock, which would regular give me 4-6 days on a charge.  The Ravine 2 gives me 2, maybe 3 days per charge.  They also removed the music player that was available on the Rock (and is obviously available on the Commando).So, all in all, it's a mixed bag, but I still like it!  The things I am griping about may be non-issues to some people, and I could see them rating it a 5/5 easily.  There are just a few gripes that I have that keep me from giving it that perfect rating 	jwilets	10-26-2015 14:41:52	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

65347562	This is an amazing...digital camera....video recorder....GPS....portable internet browser....music player....and Oh it's a cell phone too! This phone does a lot of things and does most of them very well. My wife has joked with me, I needed a Nokia pHD to use this phone. The manual is thick, and you pretty much need to read it to learn how to use this phone. The funny part on this phone, there's a ton of pages on applications, the cameras, the browser, the GPS, the music player, and the excellent contact management. But there's nothing, absolutely nothing in it on how to use predictive text... what a strange thing left out.I've used this phone for over a month now and really do love it. The 3G connection is fantastic, it works fabulously well and very fast. WiFi is simple fast and easy to use. There's actually 3 different GPS programs, frankly the Yahoo maps one works and looks the best. Pictures are sharp, easy to take, excellent. The videos are very nice, good solid large on a computer with no pixellation. The browser works amazingly well. The music player is just wonderful.So what's not to like?1) It's not intuitive to use. On the GPS, to get the GPS to follow along on the map, you have to press the 0 key. That would be a function not documented anywhere. I still can't figure out why my pictures and videos are stored in the Image Gallery, and the videos I download are stored in the Video Center. Menus are buried in funny places. I can't figure out how to quickly change the ring volume, or silence it. The volume key seems to have a mind of it's own, sometimes it changes the volume in the application, sometimes it does nothing.2) The camera - overall very good. Well no spectacular for a cell phone. It is slow to start up, it's slow to actually focus, and once you've taken a picture, it's kind of slow to be ready to take another picture. The flash - well it is effective from about 6 inches to maybe 2 or 3 feet. But, I have a 5 MegaPixel camera in my pocket all the time. That's something amazing.3) The GPS - it's needlessly complex. Like I said there are actually 3 applications to use the GPS. Nokia Maps, an application that takes an eternity to start up. Middling performance. A Maps function buried deep in a menu someplace - it's sort of you on a map with not much else to offer. And then Yahoo Maps - this is well near incredible. Satellite imagery on a moving map, so how cool is that. Navagation is not bad with Yahoo and Nokia Maps. I tried the 3 day (get that 3 days only) trial of voice navagation, definately not worth the price. In a pinch, this thing works rather well. Oh, satellite connection, it takes a very long time. Relax.4) The music player. When you use audiophile grade headphones (shure e3c), there is a definate hiss in the background. I've actually never heard this in any device before - iPod, portable DVD players, tape players, CD players. It just basically sounds like they used a very cheap op amp to power the headphone jack. Otherwise the player works very well. It's like all the others out there.5) Syncing or moving things from a computer to the phone. You cannot just drop images, sound files, videos, etc. into the proper directory on the MicroSD card. The software actually has to insert it, otherwise you never see any of those files. PC Suite works just fine. But it's not exactly computer savvy friendly at all. LifeBlog is just plain weird. It records everything you do, pictures and videos taken, text messages sent, etc. and then puts those on a timeline on your computer. Be aware, the files get stored with a serial number, and they are very hard to figure outside LifeBlog. It's all very strange.So the good stuff - it's a solid phone. Sound on phone calls is excellent. The phone book is just outstanding. The screen is gorgeous. You can actually read the screen in bright direct sunlight. I love reading the New York Times on this phone. The browser is wonderful. The number pad is perfect even with my large hands. Very quickly I got used to the navagation buttons - direction, select, back/cancel, accept... all work really well. It's a dream. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 14:43:02	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

55283634	This is a great phone though I did have a issue where I had to reboot the phone a lot there for a while. I ended up removing the cover for the sim and re-seating it. After that I had no further issues.The phones performances is fantastic, I love pretty much everything about the phone except the horrid battery life. Keep a charger handy and pray you do not need this phone to last more than 8 hrs.I would of given the phone 5 stars if the battery didn't suck so bad. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 14:49:40	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

88221991	The size to me is perfect.  I came from a Galaxy 1 that I thought was an awesome phone.  Would have stayed with it longer, but I had to get away from T-mobile.  I was all set to get the Galaxy 3, but while doing my research I came across the DNA.  Although I think I would have been happy with either phone, in the end I went with the DNABattery- I've had it ten days and never even got close to using up the battery power.  I use my phone off and on all day, make calls, apps, web, games and it has not been an issue.  On the weekends, when I am using it more, it went down to around 25% charge by the time I put it on the charger for the night.Buttons- Power and volume buttons are not as bad as some people point out.  I think the issue with that is they don't understand it takes a few days to get use to them.  Now, I am as fast at using them as I was with my old phone.Memory:  I think people are stuck in the past and are just not adapting to the future when it comes to memory.  Memory cards have been around so long that people are use to them, and don't really understand.  Wifi is everywhere and at least for me in my house.Size:  I think this phone is the perfect size.  I don't think I would want anything bigger.  It fits well into jeans and dress pants.  I don't notice the phone when I sit down.  I can still do everything with one hand just like I could with my last phone.Overall, I am really glad I bought this phone: lighting fast, with an incredible picture quality, great camera. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 14:49:46	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

40648939	WARNING Verizon has altered Windows Phone 8 and requires you to pay $2.99/month for Visual Voicemail. This ends up being a hidden penalty of $71.76 over the two year contract per phone.I have had windows phones on ATT; and T-Mobile and neither charge for Visual Voicemail. If ATT; or T-Mobile coverage is good in your area, I would highly recommend going with them instead of Verizon who alters the phone operating system to stick you with hidden costs.I have two Lumia 822 phones, and enabling Visual Voicemail will cost me $143.52 extra compared to T-Mobile or ATT.; When purchasing the phones I asked the store sales person about Visual Voicemail and he indicated it was free. I called support once I found out it costs and they were of no help.Shame on Verizon, perhaps I should have stuck with ATT; and my Lumia 920. The Lumia 920 was an awesome phone, the only issue was I had poor LTE service at my house. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 14:49:46	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

69761923	Great phone, fast, not a single problem out of it. Has not slowed down at all. It's not bulky, it's solid, it's built well, once I wipe it off, it looks like I grabbed it straight out of the box it originally came in. Yes windows phone may not have as much apps as Iphone, but they are growing, and fast. The apps we do have are KIK, 6tag (instagram), a program just like Vine called 6sec, which both programs upload to vines servers, facebook, angry bird, etc. Honestly your not missing much if you switch from iphone to windows phone. Plus, you can beam photos to another phone by having both backs touch, it's cool.This is a quick review, im just rushing as I type this, but...It's an excellent phone. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 14:50:59	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
66645407	For various family reasons, we needed to be able to make affordable voice calls back to the US while traveling in Costa Rica. This phone fit the bill just fine. Bought a Kolbi SIM card in a small grocery store (just $2), and was assigned a local phone # and PIN. Calling US cost I think 29 cents/min. Reloading more $$ on the card was easy. Texting is old-school due to no QWERTY keyboard, but manageable. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 14:50:59	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66479102	When I bought my previous phone, the Boulder's predecessor (G'zOne Type S), it was natural choice given my history of destroying my phones in various ways.  When I finally managed to destroy even the Type S, I purchased the Boulder as a logical upgrade.  Note that my review refers to the newer version of this phone with the front exterior speaker, not the model pictured here.==Aesthetics==It's ugly, my sister said upon seeing the jagged, orange-and-black exterior.  Particularly with the extended battery, it's not a sleek phone; but it does stand out.  The silver-and-black color scheme is certainly more conventional, but I found it unacceptably tame.  When I wore my old Type S, I had strangers approach to ask me about it, who'd stare in amazement when I demonstrated its distinguishing characteristic by dropping it to the floor.  The silver-and-black color scheme probably won't garner this reaction, but my model is likely to.The other factor I considered was 'findability,' given the inevitability that I will, somehow, loose this phone in an open field at night and clumsily retrace my steps.  The bright orange should be easier to spot.==Keyboard==Its keyboard is the standard 9-button layout, but the buttons are separated more than most phones (including the Type S) and I find it's easier to hit the intended key.==External Display==One thing I loved about the Type S and still love about the Boulder is that the clock is always displayed, even when the phone is inactive.  Pushing a button activates the backlight, but it's not necessary unless you're in the dark.  Since I use my phone instead as my watch, this is a great feature.The other invaluable feature is the flashlight.  We all use our phone as an occasional light source, but by toggling on the flash, the Boulder can project a light which is more directional and significantly brighter.  Moreover, it doesn't dim with inactivity and remains on if you close the phone.  It's easily bright enough to guide you through a dark hallway or during a nighttime stroll.==Battery==It comes with two: the standard battery lasts for a day of frequent internet and video usage, and the extended battery, for two or three such days.  I've not had a day where I didn't use these energy-intensive features, so I can't comment on standby longevity.==Compass==This was actually a feature I looked forward to, because when driving in a GPS-less environment I often long for such basic information as knowing which direction is North.  It works fairly well, but the phone looses points because the compass takes a few seconds to initialize AND it's the first feature you'll get to by holding down the exterior 'mode' button when the phone is closed.  Taken in combination, this means a 10-second wait if you want to navigate to the stopwatch or countdown features without opening the phone, rendering them nigh-useless.==Music/Speakers==I'm still learning the ins and outs, but the sound quality is better than I expected -- which is to say about as good as a small, inexpensive radio, like your (cheap) bedroom alarm clock.  At the highest volume level it's very loud but everything sounds terrible; I think a lot of the negative reviews stem from this aspect of the speakers, but if you default the volume at 'normal' then it's about as loud as a phone typically is, and maintains good quality.In total, I think the sound quality is perfectly fine, and I could see using this phone as background music for playing cards with friends or the like.  It's compatible with Bluetooth music players, and I've read that song quality when projected to external speakers or headphones is flawless, but haven't yet tested this myself.  Its menu function is pretty good, and fully accessible and controllable while the phone is closed, and I suspect it will completely eclipse the need for me to bring my MP3-player anywhere.  With an SD memory card, it'll hold up to 8gb of songs.==Camera==The photo camera is much nicer than the Type S.  Photo quality is just at that point where it becomes difficult to distinguish its pictures from those taken by an actual camera upon casual inspection (or when uploaded to Facebook).  It performs admirable in low-light, but motion is a deal-breaker.Video quality is pretty poor.  It's difficult to recognize what's being filmed if there's much motion, and videos appear dim.  But it can record for longer than 15 seconds (recording length is limited only by storage space, i.e., 8gb-worth or many many hours) making it superior to the Type S.  A viewer can still discern the cuteness of my baby niece or the wackiness of my cat, which, thusfar, is the extent of my empirical analysis.==Internet==I've never had an internet-capable phone before, because I remember the horrors of the old (1g?) mobile internet: it was painfully, painfully slow, and you could only access the internet, which consisted of five or six sites which told you the weather, movie showtimes, and stock quotes.This phone uses the 3g network, and now I can appreciate what that means.  It's friggin fast: in the time it takes to walk from one room to another in my house, I can pull up my Gmail account.  Most major websites are accessible, and I don't feel handicapped using the navigation pad and keyboard.Moreover, Verizon's V-cast is far better than I expected, featuring a wide array of television programming.  The videos are pixely, but certainly watchable, and the sound is fine.==Conclusion==I love this phone; it feels like it was designed for me.  Not everyone will feel the same, and probably most people won't.  But if you're looking for the 'swiss army knife' of phones -- rugged, utilitarian, feature-packed -- then look no further.  Well, look a little further because the newer version has that front speaker thing. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 14:53:40	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65203580	I replaced my 6 year old very reliable LG flip phone with Samsung S425g but I am disappointed. It suddenly stops detecting network connection for no reason. You realize this has happened when you have not gotten a single text or call for many hours. Turn off the power and turn it on it detects the wireless service and operates fine until it happens again.  I called Net10 tech support, they gave me the ridiculous reason that newer phones need a stronger cell signal to connect compared to older flip phones.

65549649	Ever since my Blackberry Curve 8900 has been dead, I've been researching phones all over the internet. My criteria were the following: decent camera (&gt;3MP), LED flash, Android 2.2 or 2.3, touchscreen, fast processor, good battery, and under 250 US dollars. After a week of researching (and being phone-less), I settled on the LG Optimus One P500 (even though it didn't have the LED flash I was hoping for).My first concern when I found this phone on Amazon was whether or not this phone would work with my T-Mobile SIM card, since the title says international version, but didn't say unlocked. I was also concerned about the lack of reviews (at the time, there were only three other reviews). After some hesitation, I placed an order with The OEM Shop.A week later, I received my phone and my first impressions were quite good. After inserting my SIM card and powering up the phone, I discovered that my T-Mobile service worked (not 100% sure if it'll work with ATT; though). After setting up and playing around for a good hour, I have a few things to say about this phone.Pros:- Fast processor; much faster than my old Blackberry- Android OS 2.2 is amazing. Haven't figured out how to upgrade to 2.3 yet, but that's supposed to be available for this phone too.- Touchscreen is responsive and accurate- Allows up to 32 GB on a micro SD card- speakerphone is great- sturdy construction and very pleasing to the eye- Extremely easy setup with your Google account- Bluetooth exchange is fast (I don't use a headset. I just tested bluetooth by sending a file from my computer)- The phone was shipped with a screen protector already applied. (I wished I knew this earlier before buying a pack of screen protectors along with the phone)Cons:- very small internal memory (170MB). I use a moderate amount of apps (I have about 20 apps installed on the internal memory with about 40MB left and 25 apps installed on the SD card). If you're a heavy app user, don't get this phone. Some apps can't be transferred to the SD card, but with some research, I think there's a way to get around this.- A little on the heavy side.- Camera quality isn't too great. Pictures are better than other cameras in its price range, but they were still not too clear.Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase. Though there are some things that bother me, I think this phone suits me very well for the price I paid. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 14:55:08	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65254855	7/4/2013I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.Construction/Design:This phone is listed as waterproof, however upon further investigation on the Motorola website, the phone is really water resistant.  I bought this phone so that my fragile i717 could miss out on abuse this summer during summer camp.Additionally, the phone is marketed as being sturdy, however there is a dent in the upper left metallic covering around the bezel just from being in my pocket with keys for a short period of time.On two occasions in the last week, I have found that the battery door has unlocked itself and detached from the phone; not good for water resistance.The 3.5mm headphone jack's rubber cover takes a great deal of force to open for the head phone jack.The d pad feels flimsy.Based on the written description here and on the Motorola site, the phone, in my opinion, deserves 3/5 stars.Camera:The camera produces dark and grainy pictures in a low light or indoors setting.I give it 3/5 stars.Features:The phone has a ton of features that are cool.It is water resistant which is a plus, however I do not want to test this feature.The built in compass seems like it could be helpful while exploring an unknown area.The vanilla Wifi hotspot feature is like a dream come true.  Most unlocked phones are still bound by Att;'s tethering rules, however this phone is stripped of that and is able to create a wifi hotsopt out of the box.The FM radio is always a good thing to have for emergencies or if there is no songs on the phone.It has a built in flash flight application that utilizes the built in flash from the camera.It gets 5/5 stars in this department.Signal:I use Pure GSM which uses Att; cell towers and the phone was able to maintain 4g/3g when my friend's iPhone 4 only got 2g or lost the signal.  It has not gone below 3G or 3 bars in the same places that my i717 loses signals all of the time.It gets 5/5Battery:This phone really shines in power management.  It can last two full days on a single charge with my usage pattern.  As a disclaimer, I work 7 hours of which I do not use the phone that much unless it is being used as a hotspot momentarily to load media onto another device.  I also play music to and from work.  If your usage pattern is similar, I would expect great battery.  However, on my i717 my battery only lasts 12 hours before it needs to be charged and that is with normal use.It gets 5/5 stars in this category.Performance:The phone is snappy on most tasks, however sluggish on some.  If you are not going to play dead space or tap tap 4, I think that it would be good for your needs.It gets 4/5 stars here.OS:The phone is running Motorola blur interface I think; it may not be so check up on that.  I cannot really tell that it is there if it is.  There is a useful Motorola widget that tracks the apps that one uses the most and keeps them in a central location for easy access.  It is not as terrible as the Motorola Charm that I use to have.There is hardly any trace that this is a phone from Rogers, the Canadian Carrier.It gets 5/5 stars here.I will update as needed.I give it 4.5 Stars out of 5 at the moment. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 14:56:38	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

The phone freezes and slows constantly.  The battery life is actually the least of my complaints with it,especially compared to some of my friends' phones.  I wish I'd ponied up the extra $50 for a better phone when I upgraded, because this phone is awful and I am probably going to have to replace it. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 14:59:21	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

73574418	I received this phone directly from Verizon.  I am proficient with Windows Phone, and loved this model.  Sadly it went back because Verizon disabled the Text grouping feature ( MMS ).  For interactive text, this is a killer bad decision.Someone posted a negative about syncing with Outlook.  To be honest, Microsoft has not supported syncing for many years.  Instead the cloud service ( much of it free ) makes it possible to access your data instantly from a variety of devices.  For email exchange, it can be available for $4 / month.  The fact that what I do on my phone appears on my computer, etc. is well worth that minor service charge.The phone is easy to use, and I love all the app integration.  The camera takes great pictures, and of course they are easy to post to friends and media.  Its very light, and easy to handle.  The call quality was excellent.If Verizon fixes the text grouping issue ( ATT has it and the earlier Verizon Win Phone had it, as does almost every other smartphone ), then I will get this phone right back.  Right now its available on Amazon for half the price, but it will give double the performance of most other phones ! 	jwilets	10-26-2015 15:02:03	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64876078	Within the first six months of me owning this phone it showed significant technical problems that make this phone a bare to use. I am someone who takes care of their phones. My last smartphone lasted me over 2 years. I hate this current phone with a passion.It constantly freezes and automatically resets itself, especially WHEN I ANSWER PHONE CALLS. Is this how far we have gotten in technology? Our phones can send tweets to millions around the world but won't answer phone calls. Worst part, the makers of this phone have no idea how to fix this issue and many people have had the same problem. Factory reset does not fix the problem and it will force you to re-download all your apps.In addition, the touch screen quality is below par from phones such as an iphone. Sending texts can become a chore because you will click the wrong letters several times in one sentence.Here's my favorite brilliant design feature: a 5mp camera with NO AUTOFOCUS. I don't care if it was 5 megapixels or 555 megapixels. If my picture is out of focus, it is going to look blurry regardless of how many damn megapixels.This phone is obviously intended to be an affordable smartphone. However, I encourage everyone out there to spend the extra 50-100 dollars and buy a phone that is actually worth having.I want to note that I have no beef with android. I think android makes great software and is a great alternative to iphones. The Alcatel One Fierce is NOT that alternative.BUYERS YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 15:02:03	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		false

64509465	TL: DR: awesome phone, I enjoy WP8 platform, I question how #34;new#34; this phone was when I received itI really enjoy this phone. For reference I've had an iPhone before making the switch to a Samsung Focus Windows phone, and then replaced that with the Nokia 920.***The pluses for Windows Phone 8***+ Live tiles are great and give loads of info at a glance. I considered getting a new iPhone or Android phone but the lack of a Live Tile analog killed that idea. I've come to depend on them. Basically each app icon is a tile, occupying space on the main screen. Those tiles display bite sized bits of info so you don't have to open the program to see new info. For example, new emails show the first couple sentences, meeting info shows up on your calendar tile, etc+ Great phone for business users - MS Office integration, Live Tiles+ Cool xbox live integration+ Good social integration if you are into that. A continuous feed of Facebook/Linked in updates in one place+ Tile UI is cleaner, more usable than the iphone/android phones I've compared. I liken those UI's to a desktop computer cluttered with shortcut icons.+ Separate inboxes for all my email accounts***The Minuses for Windows Phone 8***- The marketplace is not nearly as robust as the iPhone or Android market. However if you are like me, you only use 1% of the stuff you download - the important stuff - and that is fully represented on the marketplace.***Pluses for the Lumia 920***+ Feels sturdy. Looks big and bulky to carry in pocket, but I don't notice it when I do.+ Beautiful display. This was a standout for me in the ATT store doing comparisons with other phones.+ Stunning night pictures - this aspect of the camera really impressed me. Very high detail photos+ Runs fast - apps open fast+ Decent battery life. I'm a heavy user and I can usually get away with charging it when I get home at night and having a day's charge the next day.+ Gorilla glass prevents most scratches+ Good call quality+ Speakerphone is pretty good, but volume perhaps a little low+ Infinitely better than the Samsung Focus I had.***Minuses for the Lumia 920***- The Nokia Drive app (think Google maps navigation) is really hit and miss sometimes.- Day shots with the camera can look blurry on occasion- I never had a protective case - dropped it many times without issue - but one drop smashed the entire display. But like I said, I did not use a protective case.AS FOR THIS SELLER: I have to question how *new* this phone was when I received it. This is actually my second 920 since my cat knocked mine off the table, hitting it just right and smashing the display. I was searching for a way to get a new phone without paying a ridiculous amount of $$$ since I was not ready for upgrade discount. When I pulled the laminate off the screen I noticed a number of very small micro-scratches. A brand new factory-sealed phone would not have these scratches. I wonder if this was a used phone that could pass for new, and then someone cleaned it up for resale. I'm speculating here, but the micro-scratches seem suspicious to me. But I did get this far below what my carrier would charge me.My advice, get the phone, but buyer beware when using this seller. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 15:03:44	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		false

65053902	The two complaints I have about the phone should be non-issues for any phone.1) Frequent reboots for no reason. From what I have read this is a VERY common problem and seems to be caused by a loose housing for the battery, enabling it to lose contact and shut off.2) The world's touchiest power switch. Touch it for 1 millisecond and the phone wakes up. Touch it for 2 milliseconds and the phone powers off. And the power switch is VERY sensitive.If I can keep the phone on when I want it to be on, I am very happy with it. I love that I can get over the air radio stations (they should advertise that feature and make the software for it more easily available), and that there are lots of cases available. I didn't buy it for the 3D camera, I knew that was just gimmicky. It works just ok. Not a deal maker or breaker.If I had to make the purchase again, I would probably try the HTC One V, or the Galaxy S II 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 15:03:44	Neutral	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Display		false

65083273	I bought this phone to replace my old one, which was getting old and [...].  This is possibly the best cell phone I've ever had.

The way I see it, if the battery lasts until I plug it in at night, with a little to spare, that's good enough.  I can see if they are flying all the time, but who is so lazy that plugging in their phone every night, as opposed to every three or so nights, is a big sleep-loosing issue?  I've ordered a car charger on Ebay, just in case, since at a moments notice I may find myself driving or flying cross-country.  As soon as I find a spare battery, I'll buy it, for the same reason.The phone is big, compared to my last phone, which wasn't a smartphone, didn't have a QWERTY keyboard, had a tiny screen, and didn't do anything other than place calls.  However, compared to other smartphones, it's about the right size, and feels good in the hand as well.  It's also much smaller than a PDA phone, or a PDA/cell phone/MP3 player/movie player cluster of devices that all need their own batteries, chargers, add-ons and doodads.  Frankly, nobody should be whining about the size, since the dimensions are clearly stated.  Doesn't anybody own a ruler?It is somewhat a pain to configure this phone for internet access.  According to Cingular, all their phones have some top-secret software installed that magically allows them to access the net.  Since their programmers didn't have a chance to work their voodoo on this phone, there's absolutely no chance that it'll work with their internet service.  Well, after a bit of fiddling with the settings, much trial and error, and looking at the settings of their other phones (available on their web site) it worked just fine.  I managed to view most web sites, except those with Shockwave animation, which seems to shut down the browser (same as my PocketPC).  CAUTION! I racked up [...] in internet charges with just a few minutes of browsing.  After you get it working, I strongly suggest you enroll in a data plan.As for some of the other issues folks complain about, there are three things to keep in mind:1) This phone is bought from a third party, and was never offered by any US service provider.  That means it is up to YOU to set everything up, or have that nerdy kid down the street do it for you.  It wasn't overly complex for me, and though I have some experience with networking, I am by no means a pro.2) There is a firmware update for this phone.  You much check out their web site for downloads and instructions.  As it is, my phone had the latest firmware, which was a very nice touch.3) This phone was the first Sierra Wireless made, as well as the last.  Unlike Sony, Nokia, Motorola, and others, they didn't have years and years to polish their design, work out kinks, respond to customer feedback, and so forth.  They boldly tried to make phones, did an incredible job for a first try, found the phone business to be filled with too many lawsuits and much drama, and quietly bowed out.  This means you aren't going to get a perfect phone, and support for this phone will eventually dry up altogether.  Be prepared for this.I don't think this (or any) phone was ever worth [...] mainly because of the limitations of Windows Mobile and a device that must be around the size of a cell phone.  It is certainly a bargain [...], with no contract, unlocked, brand new, and a fairly complete software package.  It's also not a huge loss if it gets stolen or broken.Kudos to Sierra Wireless for a great phone.  I only wish they had time to build more refined models.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Update 9/20/06First of all, this phone DOES work with the new SIM cards from Cingular.  I turned it on, placed a call, and received a call, all without problems.  I also got full bars in my living room, which even my brand new phone doesn't get.Unfortunately, I was unable to find an external antenna adapter.  According to one source, the connector was designed for a car kit adapter, sort of a quick-connect type thing.  I did buy the car kit, however, the antenna connector barely touches the contacts, so it's unlikely you'll get a solid, reliable connection that's suitable for data, although it probably works very well with voice.I stand behind by review (except for the spelling mistakes...oops)I went through three phones, all brand new with oodles of modern goodies and fancy bling, before I found one to replace the VOQ, and even then I was disappointed with the OS, which is Windows Mobile 5.  There is a lot more software out there for WM 2003se than WM 5.In fact, I haven't decided yet if my current phone is The One.If you can find the car kit (found mine on Ebay) it might be a worthy investment.  The VOQ slides right in, and the kit can either be installed in one car, or moved from vehicle to vehicle.  It comes with the parts to do both.  The only bad thing is the antenna, which is lame, but you can buy a Wilson antenna and hook it right up to the connector.The performance is very good.  I've played several games on the VOQ, and it performed flawlessly, with no slowdowns.  Other apps did slow down at times, but it never locked up.The mono headset is the best wired headset I've used.  The stereo headset is good for music, but not good at all for calls.I've been using a 2 gig SD card with no problems, although I've heard the max capacity is 512 mb.  There's something to be said for a standard size SD card, which is very rare with phones today.  No silly adapters for mini or micro SD cards, inexpensive, and easily removed without having to shut down, remove the battery and SIM, and all that nonsense which seems to be the standard with today's phones.The phone felt solid when I first got it, and after a few months of using it I can say it is very solid.If this had bluetooth, heck, if it just had a good external antenna adapter, I'd keep it.  I even considered digging around in there and soldering a good connector, but after having tried a bluetooth headset, I can't see going back to wired.I still haven't decided whether to put the VOQ on Ebay.  Should something happen to my current phone, which is too expensive to quickly replace and which Cingular refuses to insure, again because it's too expensive, I'd have a real hard time going back to a cheap normal phone.  I'm even having a hard time giving up my QWERTY keyboard.

41794654	I got this phone Jan 21st 2013. The next generation of phones were supposed to be released in another 3 months but I didn't want to wait. I was upgrading from an iPhone 4 and mainly wanted a bigger screen, quad core, and 4g. I narrowed my choice down to the HTC One X+ and the LG Optimus G. When I got to the ATT; store to look at both, physically the Optimus G looked way nicer. It wasn't until I used both of them and talked to the sales rep that I was sold on the One X+. The display one the HTC is hands down nicer, having great detail and color. The LG looked a little grainy, worse than what I was used to looking at on my old iPhone 4. The other thing is that the LG has a glass back which means if dropped the back and front are susceptible to breaking. No thanks. The rubberized back on the HTC would be more functional, gripping the inside of my pocket and any surface I put in on. That may not seem very important but I dropped my old phone way too many times from it sliding out of my pocket, off a smooth surface, or sliding around in the car. The HTC is also a great deal lighter and feels slimmer. The battery life is good, lasting just as long as my iPhone 4 when the battery saver option is switched on. Without battery saver on, it sucks down the battery fast. The camera turns on so fast on this phone too, there is very little lag time, which is nice if you want to catch a photo quickly. The switch from photo to video, and front facing to rear facing camera is also fast. The app manager button is handy and I find myself using it all the time now, and overall the phone is more intuitive for me to use than my girlfriend's Samsung Galaxy Note II. It also seems to run faster and with less glitches than hers. I havent downloaded a ton of apps yet (maybe 10) and haven't jammed up the phone with multiple widgets and home screens, but it handles running a workout app with pdf in the internet browser, messages, email, and music in background just fine. Call quality and the speaker are on par with most other phones but nothing that really stand out to me as clearly superior.All in all I am very pleased with this phone. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 15:14:04	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	Other	Hardware	Internal Hardware	battery saver helps conserve battery.	false
66842592	The 200 minute purchase was delivered to my house, via USPS,  within the 1 - 3 day timeframe quoted by the seller.  As others have pointed out, rather than a Minutes Card, the seller mails a piece of paper containing the PIN number and instructions.  I have no issue with that process, and readily loaded the minutes into my phone.This is the best price I found for the 200-minute card, considering you don't have to pay any taxes or fees as you would through TracFone or a retailer.  Alas, this will change for Massachusetts buyers in October 2013 because our governor and Amazon struck an agreement whereby the state's .065% tax will apply to our Amazon purchases as of that date. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 15:14:04	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

19683016	The phone is nice and has all the basic necessities. It looks pretty sturdy too. It is dual sim. It is NOT touchscreen, but it is colored. Color is vivid and I love that you are able to see many lines of the message at one view.The reviews do not match what is being shown (I realized this before the purchase but I needed a basic phone) and I'm not sure what particular related product it is that is being described that has Skype and all. This phone does NOT have wi-fi connection but is mobile internet-capable via GPRS. I haven't been able to test the water-proofness yet.It arrived on time and in a package that fits the mailbox. I think it sat inside the mailbox for a couple of days that when I opened it, the phone was a bit hot. The outside of the phone is made of shiny metal alloy that seems to respond to the temperature of the environment pretty quickly. If its cold, it would be cold too.I also found it very hard to open the back of the phone to insert my simcard. It takes a bit of time to figure out and some effort to take the back cover out.It does not come with a memory card, and unless you have a memory card the camera/photos and music are useless. The camera photos are very low res anyway.To sum it up, its a good phone as it allows you to do the basic stuff, but you cannot expect too much from it. Its good for back-up. I use it for my roaming simcard when traveling. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 15:15:20	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66826139	I purchased this phone last July 2011 and the power button is broken.  I followed the instruction and shipped back to HTC for repair.  HTC claimed Amazon is not authorize dealer and need to charge 60 dollars.  I called Amazon and they said it should be manufacturer warranty (HTC), but since Amazon is not authorize dealer and HTC denied the claim.FOR YOUR REFERENCE, ALL THE INFORMATION BELOW means NOTHING since Amazon is not authorize dealer (HTC repair department told me).  Very disappointed.  And the phone is sold directly from Aamzon.com LLC directly!--------------------------------------http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200355910--------------------------------------Nexus One Warranty InformationReturns and warranty: WarrantyHow long does the warranty cover the phone?Your warranty coverage depends on where you live:European Union: the warranty coverage extends twenty-four (24) months from the date of original purchase.All other locations (including the United States): the warranty coverage extends twelve (12) months from the date of original purchaseWhat kind of things are NOT covered by the warranty?The warranty does not cover physical damage to the surface of your Nexus One, including but not limited to cracks or scratches on the screen or camera lens. The warranty also does not provide coverage for issues related to third-party applications you've installed. What kind of things can void the warranty coverage?Here are a few examples of actions that void the warranty coverage:rough handling of the deviceexposure of the device to extreme conditionstampering with the device, including removal or defacing of the serial number, IMEI number, or water indicatorunauthorized opening or repair of the devicetampering with or short-circuiting the batteryunlocking the bootloader using the fastboot programFor a complete list, refer to the warranty card included with your Nexus One and also available below. How does the warranty process work?HTC offers two options for the warranty process:Device swap: The device swap is the quickest way to get a working phone again. A new device will be sent to you, together with a box for returning the defective device. You should remove the SIM card, the battery, and the microSD card from the defective phone, insert them into the new device, and return the defective phone in the box provided.If you have engraved your phone with a personal message, the device that you receive will not include the engraving, and the engraving on the defective device will not be sent back to you. If you want to keep your engraving, you can opt for the express repair option.Express repair: With this option, you send the defective device to the HTC service center. HTC will perform the repair and send you back your device, including the original engraving.How can I initiate a warranty repair?The first step is to request a ticket number by calling HTC, the number for which can be found in the Service  Repair section of the HTC website. An HTC representative will guide you through the process and either (a) arrange for the delivery of the swap device or (b) send you shipping instructions to an email address you provide (if you prefer the express repair model).What happens if I send my device for warranty repair, and it turns out the defect is not covered by the warranty?If the HTC service center detects that the device is not covered by the warranty, an HTC representative will contact you to determine what to do next. You can choose to pay for the repairs (the HTC representative will provide you a quote), or you can opt to have HTC send you back the device, in which case your credit card will be charged the round-trip shipping fees, as well as an examination fee of $28. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 15:17:29	Complaint	Unable to Use	Hardware	Other	Hardware	Enclosure	spoke to company	false

65907461	I have this phone since it came out. After more than a year i know all the goods and the bads of this phone. Unlike other reviewers having this phone for a week or so.Out of the box this phone was not working properly. The backlight won't go on when i would unlock the phone. I did research and find a new firmware wich fixed the issue.Here is all the bads:-the photos made with flash look awfull.glare shows in almost every picture.-bad design for camera slider. Lots of dust gets there. Also sometimes it slides by itself in my pocket.-photo gallery is slow and still doesn't have option to upload photos to facebook. There is an app for viewing the pix wich after one year is still in beta. Can't be set as a default photo viewer.-in one year and still didn't get used to this keyboard. At the beginning of a sentence i have to press twice for a special character  number. In the middle of the sentence only once.- often i would not be able to answer a phone call. The screen is unresponsive.-The answer call and hang up '' buttons'' to close to eachother.  hard press buttons woud be better instead of touch ones. I could answer a call while driving without looking at the phone. Than slide to activate loudspeaker.-the shiny silver frame peeded off showing cheap platic.-No stopwatch and countdown.-i had like 10gb of music in it (out of 32gb max) and it takes forever to scroll thru the music files.-Nokia maps is a joke. Would never find my location where google maps find it on the spot.-bad memory management. I have to delete all the time cookies and cachee to make like 20mb space in the phone.-it takes like 5 seconds to open a simple sms.sometimes even more.-slow browser. I have opera installed so i stop usind the default one. It would be nice to be able to set the opera browser as default-ovi store is a failure. no usefull programs to be found there .I had to send the phone back for repairs last year in august. The headphone was not connected to it but showing that its connected. So the only way to hear someone on the phone was to activate the speaker or connect some headphones. They fixed it , did a factory reset and installed the latest firmware. No change on performance. I guess symbian sucks.Yes. The operating sistem is worst out there.I could go more and more but i have to go. This review was written from a HTC my touch 4G. Sorry for the typos. I will never buy a nokia again.

65645225	OK - please bare in mind that when I got my Blackberry a few years ago, I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. I LIVED on it in my work and personal life, and recommended it highly. The problems started over a year ago when BB couldn't seem to create a BB updater for MAC (which I am on). I won't bother with this story here, suffice it to say, it left the door open for me to consider something else....Admittedly, I would have gone in for the IPhone, but I am on Verizon exclusively, so all I could do was sit around and wonder.I was very intrigued by the first DROID, but wondered if alot of their claims were just hype as all new smart phones bill themselves as the next big thing (think Palm Pre - which now looks like the Edsel) so I waited. And read. And listened. And finally I fell in with all the suckers and decided to actually WAIT to own the Droid X.Well, today it arrived....And while discerning folks will note that I can't talk about bugs or fixes yet, what I can share after being on this phone all day today is this:1. The camera is SPECTACULAR -- and, hello BB, it actually has a flash! Who knew?2. The apps are incredible and literally make the BB offerings look embarassing3. The screen (and visually in general) makes the BB look like it's alot older than it actually is4. Call quality is superior5. Touch screen (which I was hesitant about) is excellent, and in many ways superior to BB's keyboard6. Simply put, the Android OS can do things that BB could only envy (voice-activated e-mail, texts, search)7. Integration across platforms is nothing (i.e. if you use Google Chrome this device is unbelievably easy to sync -- and even if you don't, good luck syncing BB with a MAC....seriously)8. This is really an addition to #7, but the truth is that BB never made ANY real attempts at integrating their device with the realities of the rest of what all of us rely on. In fact, I remember being excited when Google made an appfor BB...well, Google woke up and said f### BB, why don't we make our own phone?!? (or at least OS for many phones)Of all of these, #8 is why you should buy one.The End. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 15:19:59	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
34215125	I can't say enough good things about the Nokia 920.  I've been very impressed so far.  My last two phones were a Samsung Focus S running Windows Phone 7 which I enjoyed, except for the small amount of good apps compared to iOS and Android.  But Windows Phone 8 is next level -- especially with all the quality apps that are now available.  Software developers are clearly jumping on board now.  Prior to trying the Windows Phone OS I owned an iPhone 3G.  The Windows Phone OS, WP8 in particular, is superior to iOS in so many ways.  It all starts with the user interface.  While iOS and Android use fairly similar desktop based interfaces with icons we've known since the early 90s, Microsoft actually innovated with Windows Phone and created something unique.  While I'm not as excited about the smart tile interface on a large desktop screen; it is excellent on a phone, tablet, or smaller laptop.  The Nokia hardware itself is very impressive.  The phone is responsive and has never crashed on me once -- something I can't say for my iPhone 3GS or Samsung.  My only complaint is the phone does feel a bit heavy - but it also has a very nice camera and the battery life is longer than last two phones (even with the new phone using 4G LTE).  The Nokia build quality definitely feels sturdier than the Samsung I owned.  The Samsung was lighter, but it also felt like cheaper plastic at times.  My other complaint with the Nokia is it doesn't appear the battery can easily be removed/replaced.  Nokia should fix that and not follow the iPhone route with battery access.To me, the bottom line is despite being late to the game, Windows Phone 8 is by far the best mobile phone OS.  Not only that, the 920 is a great value.  I got one for $100 with a 2-yr contract renewal.If you have ATT;, you may want to wait though.  The 920 is awesome, but if you take a lot of photos, Nokia has announced a newer Lumia model with a camera in the 40 megapixel range (sorry I don't have exact number).  It will be by far the best camera in a mobile phone ever.  I've read it will retail for $299 with a 2-yr contract.  The Lumia 920 is still an excellent choice.  It has gotten very good reviews -- PC world gave it 4.5 stars out of 5 -- the same rating they give the iPhone and Galaxy 3.  It may not be the coolest phone right now, but if you aren't a teenager -- try it out and I think you'll be pleased. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 15:19:59	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66972351	I bought an LG Volt and side by side compared it to the Samsung S3.The Volt does everything pretty well, although there was some intermittent glitchiness in the GPS that I noticed.The battery life claims are no joke.  Using it heavily for testing purposes, I still had about 65% battery left after 12 hours of use.It feels a bit clunkier and cheaper than the S3, but neither one of them would be mistaken for an iphone, and besides, this is a value phone on a value carrier, so no razzle-dazzle is expected.The comparison came to an end when I realized that the Volt I'd bought wouldn't connect to the local LTE coverage from Sprint.  Virgin Mobile reps insisted that this was because LTE isn't offered in my area, but the S3 connected just fine and got me 20-25 mbps of download speed compared to just 1 mbps on the Volt using their 3g network.The screen is pretty plain, but it's perfectly adequate, and it has slightly better outdoor visibility than the S3, owing to the different screen technology between the two devices.  The S3 has a super-amoled screen and the Volt has an IPS screen, I believe.This is a good workhorse, no-frills type of smartphone, but make sure that your area has Sprint 4g LTE coverage, or else it won't really be worth upgrading to this device from an older smartphone. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 15:23:48	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65458074	.L.but maybe after I cool off a bit I will revise my review.  The Note 3 I purchased was supposed to be new.  The box it arrived in had been previously opened.  The box was torn up on the inside and the ear buds are missing. The phone seems fine.  I haven't even turned it on yet.  Many may say that I'm being too picky...but s*** like this really bothers me.  I paid over $800.00 for this phone!  I should get exactly what I paid for!10/13/2013Okay I had some time to calm down. And thanks to a response to my review I have been made aware that ATT; repackages there phones and remove the ear buds.  Sorry for griping about nothing.  I have upgraded this phone from 3 stars to a much deserved 5 stars.  This phone kicks butt! My favorite features are the big brilliant display and the s pen. I just can't put this thing down. I can't find anything wrong with this phone other than the enormous amounts of bloatware. But, most cell phone have this problem. I highly recommend this phone. It's a beast!

If it wasn't because I bought it to replace my old phone and I need something to use, I would return it for being too small for my taste.

14488147	I happen to own an ATT; lumia 900 after I had the unlock code given by ATT; last October 8, 2012  but soon I realized that while the screen is crisp, a lot of the screen remained unused until the day I got the windows 7.8 last January 31, 2013. The experience dramatically changed for the better with the resizeable tiles of the windows phone 8 format. I decided against buying an ATT; locked phone because even when it has been unlocked, the hotspot function remains disabled (Disabled by ATT;) and therefore can't be shared. There is no WCDMA-only network choice hence, so much of my connection is 2G or Edge which is so disappointingly slow. This limited connectivity held me back from upgrading to the newer lumia 920 but, I soon discovered that you can actually commit network connectivity to 3g only (equivalent to WCDMA-only) by dialing ##3282#. After that discovery, it did not take me long to get the upgraded Lumia 920. So much for the introduction I found the following positives for this Nokia lumia 920 vs 900.1. Fast response and buttery smooth operation.2. Resizeable tiles and fonts are really nice.3. The camera is heaven and earth different and much much better compared to older lumia 900.4. 3G-only connectivity can be set by dialing ##3282 on windows phone 8.5. The charging port is now below rather than on top...I love it!6. Nice crisp screen.7. Built-in wallet App is really cool. By putting your card name number, security code and expiry, it  automatically identifies your billing information and address. This is now readily available to purchase Apps.8. Whilie there maybe Apps missing windows 8 makes it easy to pin sites making it handy for access from the screen.This is my fourth generation windows phone and after having used Samsung Galaxy Nexus as my second phone as I normally carry two rather than just one, I eventually gravitated back to windows phone after I discovered how to dedicate network connectivity to 3G only. If only people will give it a shot, it is a very nice and capable OS.......if microsoft will succeed in integrating the windows market place for windows phone 8 Apps  that are  compatible with windows 8 PC OS, it will really become a force to reckon with in the future!!!I believe that the future is great for windows to shine down the road!!! 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 15:30:03	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

82777701	As ridiculous as this launch has been, I have to say this phone is worth the wait.I'll keep this review and try not to duplicate comments already echoe'd.My Pros:  (outside of the obvious awesome display, camera and overall great UI)Wireless Charging! - When announced, I knew this was going to be a killer feature.  I kept hearing people discount the feature and whine about it only being 70-75% of a normal charge.  So what!?  To be able to set my phone down for a quick charge in between calls/text/whatever is great!!New Tile Interface -  Windows 7.5 was great, but having the entire (gutter-less) screen to work with is awesome.Nokia Apps - This would be a deal breaker for me.  I considered the HTC, but not having the Nokia apps was a void for me.Cons:This my second Lumia 920.  I originally purchased the glossy red (which looks GORGEOUS, but is a finger print MAGNET) and it became unresponsive after about 3-4 hours of normal use.  I returned to ATT; and ended up going to my local Microsoft store to purchase the matter Cyan version.  Love the matte style. However, I've already had this one freeze once.  Had to let the battery die and restart.  No problems since, but it a bit of a concern going forward.  Especially when I'm trying to sell this new platform to my friends and family.  (that's probably when it will happen again, go figure.)Hope this helps! 	jwilets	10-26-2015 15:35:13	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	Replacement	Hardware	Display		false

66914056	Item listed as New and sold by Jet Set Market and fulfilled by Amazon. Item arrived in an ATT; box as expected. However, the phone itself is far from new. I am dissapointed that Amazon just chooses to do business with anyone. I choose this particular seller though the order was fulfilled by Amazon thinking that if anything it must be a good seller if Amazon fulfills their orders. There is a sticker on the outside of the ATT; box that lists IMEI number, serial number etc. I noticed right out of the box that the phone had visual damage to the front speaker part that is at the very top part of the phone. It it bent. Next I turned the phone over and saw that the label-cover that is screwed on to the inside of the phone (the labels containing the IMEI number, serial number etc where you insert your battery) was coming undone. Up close you can clearly see that the cover has been tamered with and see that the inside screws have been unscrewed before. Now granted, the phone is unlocked so I am fully aware that the seller had to insert a battery, power the phone up in order to unlock the phone, but there is no need to remove the INTERNAL battery cover, that is the battery cover on the inside of the phone not the outside battery lid/cover, unless someone replaced a part on the inside of the phone. As per another buyer's review who had contacted HTC for a warranty issue and then discovered that his phone had an IMEI number that had already been registed, I called HTC to check on the phone I had infront of me when I noticed that the phone I orderd has a serial number on the inside of the phone that is different than the one listed on the box. The box label and the phone label have the same IMEI number but the serial numbers are different. The HTC rep told me that this can be due to the fact that the motherboard of the phone could have been replaced. In such cases, they use the same IMEI number but serial number can change. In anycase, not only is the phone visible damaged on the front speaker, but also tampered with in the inside as well as serial numbers not matching. I contacted Amazon who issued a refund immediately and send me a prepaid return label. Needless to say, they offered to send me a new phone however just a few days after ordering my phone which was sold by Jet Set Markets (also listed as Samina Ladha) today Amazon is fulfulling the order sold by Ross Cellular. Ross Cellular was the seller who sold the phone with an already registered IMEI number to the other buyer I read a review by. I decided to take my refund and shop elsewhere. I am dissapointed in the sellers Amazon chooses to do business with but thankful that they refunded me promptly.Update: 11/15/12 . . . I kept my eyes on this listing and I noticed in the span of only a couple of days Amazon changes their sellers that they fulfill their orders from.  Their computer system must randomly pick sellers they have an agreement with.  Exact same phone and listing but new sellers every other day.  Having said that, my experience is based on the seller Jet Set Markets (also comes up under name Samina Ladha).  As a buyer who reads a negative review/experience look for the name of the seller, if listed in the review, as this will make a big difference in your buying experience.  There are plenty of reviews on this site from happy customers.  I just wish they would have listed who they actually bought from.  I based my own buying decision on the positive reviews thinking it was the same seller as listed in the advertisement only to discover they change every so often.  My advise, read through the reivews especially the negative ones and see if a seller's name is listed and stay clear from that particular seller.  If another seller is listed under the phone you are buying that day, then make your decisions accordingly.  Good Luck!If Amazon approves, I uploaded two photograph of the phone to go with my reivew.  Look under customer pictures above. 	jwilets	10-26-2015 15:37:08	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	Replacement	Hardware	Enclosure		false

I am not able to expound on the technical details and will emphatically state that the inability to get the data plan transferred was not due to any faulty features of the phone but was due to the provider.Buyers beware! Check with your phone service provider before purchasing to ensure that this model will connect to their network, be it 2G, 3G or 4G.The touch key pad will take some getting used to.

64727052	I'm glad it wasn't only me who dislike the phone!!1) SOOOO SLOW! There have been many situations where I had to reply to someone immediately (both phone and text) but the phone didn't respond quick enough. It has such a weird delayed reaction! I'm talking delayed as in up to 30secs!2)Freezes. A LOT.3)Just plain ugly. I went from Razr to this. The phone seemed so thick! And did I mention it's ugly?4)Buttons on front get pushed accidentally while in backpack. I'm not sure if there is a way to lock the three front keys, but I never figured out how to. The phone comes with this weird song, and that song would play when the middle front button was pushed. Almost got my phone taken away at school many times. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 19:22:07	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

65630598	I've had this phone for about a month now, and got the chance to use it extensively and here is my impression:Top Qualities: (5/5)-Excellent built quality, slimmest smart phone in the market, Looks and feels great in hand.-Fast, responsive and solid android phone.-Great value phone for its specifications and build quality.-Excellent front camera (5MP, good contrast and color reproduction, I am a professional photographer, so you can definitely count on my review about phone cameras)-Expandability (Micro SD)-Great power management and comes with lots of default control over apps usage and access limitation.-Quite excellent battery life, can easily go through a day with extensive use and still got 20-30% battery left, on moderate use, would go through 2 days easily.-Screen (even though it is not high-end Full-HD) has a great angle of view and color reproduction and contrast.-Doesn't come with any bloatware, easy and intuitive theme to use.-According to the company news the update to Android KitKat would be available soon (February)-Excellent call qualityAverage qualities(3/5)-Back camera (8MP) is average quality, color reproduction and contrasts are great, though can have color noise in low light. Doesn't have optical image stabilizer.-Not much default widgets provided by company, limited theme.-Average speaker quality.-Phone can heat up if used extensively for gaming. Though I haven't noticed any heating for any other use.-Screen is not Full HD-Cannot keep up with other phones like HTC one or Nexus 5 in terms of performance, though this wouldn't be an issue if not used for gaming.-I noticed some lag in keyboard response, though I am an incredibly fast typer on phone, this could be just me, but definitely not as good as iOS's keyboard.Low quality (1/5)-Horribly located earphone jack (on bottom left pointing left to the left of phone) it would be a great hassle putting the phone in the pocket while headphone is attached.-Bad location for USB connection (top) if used for mounting on stereo equipments, phone would be upside down!-Very unpredictable exposure metering in the front camera, It is very center weighted so a black object at the center can completely cause the image to be over exposed.-The app menu is removed, all the apps by default has to be on the desktop! This might get fixed by updating to kitkat.Overal I think it is an excellent choice for people who don't use the phone for gaming, looking for moderately priced, stunning looking phone that can provide just about anything that high-end android phones like htc one or S4 offer. I would definitely recommend this phone. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 19:24:21	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Ports		false

64705065	I bought this phone to use with pre-paid SIM cards while studying abroad in Europe. For making calls, the phone works great. My main gripe is that there is no predictive text feature for English (for Spanish and French there is). It makes using SMS messages as a means of communication a bit cumbersome. Given the price, I think this phone would be great for those using it while travelling, as opposed to day to day use. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 19:24:21	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Settings	Software		false
65115893	Overall the phone is ok, but in the end it is doing the same thing my Galaxy S2 does. There is a feature called daydream, when you charge your phone u can pick a screen saver basically, that only worked the first two charges. My phone stays on, even when on the charger. It does not even go into the lock screen mode and I don#8217;t have any feature on for the phone to always be on. The phone does my vibrate when a text message comes in if it is on vibrate.  I had to go in the  settings to put the messages on vibrate, which ALWAYS vibrate even when my phone is on sound. This is annoying to me. Still no flash player. I really like the camera. Can#8217;t believe they got rid of the menu button. From time to time my settings just disappear. I still hav eto charge my phone EVERYDAY! The phone is OK but not what I thought it would be. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 19:31:14	Neutral	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Features	Internal Hardware		false
65649718	So I started up with a free one from Tiger Direct. The first one that came in simply didnt have the power to display the starting graphics. Ok, it happens. Next, I get a replacement and its works fine for a week. It then slows down to a crawl! It would lag with the simplest of tasks such as a calculator. It is however rather water resistant as it fell in Lake Tahoe and managed to survive. Avoid though, its simply a really slow excuse of a phone. That and it's screen isn't really life proof as Motorola says. It's screen and digitizer (the actual screen) cracked. I now have a phone with a dead screen from a 5ft fall. My iPod is stronger than that. Simply put, if you can get it for free be cautious, but if you end up having to pay over $20, avoid it and save for a better phone. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 19:31:14	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Display		false

65027421	I purchased the unlocked GSM phone, and have been extremely disappointed. The phone periodically resets during phone calls, and drops calls randomly. When I called support, they had me do a number of inneffective actions with each call. Finally, I was told that they had a know hardware issue and that I could send my phone in, and within 1-2 weeks I would have it returned, or I could have it expedited (1 week) for 25.00. Either  way I am very dissatisfied as I am paying for a known issue in their product and spent several hours to get any resolution. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 19:34:23	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

64459490	This is how I got to communicate and be able to describe my current problem, I hope you can help me with the answer.This week, on June 27, my HTC One S recently bought (Order #: 107-5401262-5581804, Order Date: January 11, 2014 and like new) introduced battery failure. I think it is too recent to have had than to change. My husband and son have similar and theirs have 1 year and 7 months and have not had battery problems yet.Previously mentioned the lack of adiacute;fonos, and I was recognized by Amazon, atmbieacute;n comment qe I missed the box where it came from, it's not white packaging as anime that identifies HTC, unlike cardboard box that identifies Connectivity, and code bar that identifies the telephone box. I really hope my phone is new, that box is unimportant but I worry about the battery, just under 5 months of use and damage already? . 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 19:37:31	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

Colors look good just more like they are drawn with pastels.Final ThoughtsFor the money there is no better option, even money aside the only other phone that may be slightly better is the GS3. Tmobile has a prepaid $30 a month unlimited Data/Texting plan, and you can use a VOIP service with your data plan to get unlimited talk.If you can drop $350, there certainly is no reason to be on a contract with your carrier anymore.-Side note you will have to pay tax on the $350 even if you order online. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 19:37:31	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Enclosure		false
65279585	At first I was afraid of buying a phone online and from a third party rather then straight from samsung or a store such as ATT.; However, I was very happy with this. It came with everything needed, and works perfectly.As for the phone itself, it's very lightweight and has a beautiful screen. The only complaint would be the battery life, which isn't super amazing. But it's still worth the money :)It's not flawlessly fast like some of the higher end Android phones (you can tell this difference if you use live wallpapers and have programs running- compare from phone to phone), but for most people this won't be an issue at all. For almost all uses, it's fast.If you can't afford crazy expensive higher end phones, this is a good choice for you :) The best quality for the price. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 19:37:31	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

73837504	I bought it via google play store for 299.99. It came a week earlier than they predicted. It looks awesome. It feels extremely solid, well built.  And the Jelly Bean OS is flawless and not cluttered with some manufacture's random crap. The phone has not made one hiccup. No crashes. No error messages. Nothing. It just works. Best android phone out there. My girlfriend has the Iphone 5, and I find it painful to use after playing my with Nexus 4. My screen is bigger, the processor is snappier etc etc.The only cons so far....the speaker phone is a little weak. The battery is not amazing. Its not bad, just not amazing. It lasts 3-4 movies streaming netflix with wifi and 4g on. About 7-8 hours of heavy use. Light use and it will last all day. I guess not having a microSD slot is a con, but with all the google cloud apps, not a big deal.I am 110% satisfied, and glad I didn't waste twice as much money on a lesser phone.Update-Still the best phone I have ever owned. The battery is not as great these days. The back glass cracked somehow. and after the android update to 4.3 I get constant notifications to select a keyboard language...wtf google. I am looking for its replacement now. I am still happy with my purchase. I have put it through some hard times and its taken it like a champ. but it definitely shows signs of wear.

46650855	Bought two of these for an upcoming trip to Europe.  I don't understand the negative reviews.  If you want a cheap, functional, handy little phone, this one works just fine.  Yes, it comes set up for Spanish speaking users.  If you go to a local store to buy a SIM card (required), they can show you how to change the settings so the prompts are in English, or see my directions below.  The manual is completely useless, but this is not a very complicated device--really, you can figure it out yourself.  I have used these phones a little here without problems, and will post an update after the trip to let you know how they worked in Europe.  NOTE:  you have to use a tiny precision flat-blade screwdriver, or similar small tool (a coin is too thick and your fingernail will be ruined), to take the back of the phone off (to access battery and SIM cards), and you have to be very careful to really snap the back panel back on ALL AROUND the sides and corners of the back of the phone.  It can look like it's on and then you press some more and hear those positive clicks that let you know it wasn't properly attached, but is now.  Long battery life, good at holding a charge.Changing the Interface to English:Press the top part of the left hand rocker switch (press the horizontal white line) to select #34;Menuacute;.#34;  Use right side of the large center rocker switch (click the right arrow five times) to move to the second screen of the menu and highlight the picture of a wrench and sprockets.

Press the bottom of the rocker switch (down arrow) to highlight the 3rd option (green) #34;Configuracioacute;n del teleacute;phono.#34;  Again press the center of the rocker switch to select this option.

91423180	Phone is great. I've had this for few months now.There is huge community that helps with development of Custom ROMs and Kernels, and that covers up flaws that Nexus 4 has.....Since its one of the few first generation quad core phone, with small battery it does run out quite fast even with Google trying to help with it by throttling the speed of phone when heated. So far CM+Franco Kernel was the best Battery saver for me, but if you find better combination please comment below.Another Flaw is the Navigational bar, which can also be fixed with any Custom ROM. Not all apps in the market is built to Google's new design guides. A lot of apps don't have the three dot buttons(Essentially a menu button). The virtual bar does pop up a small one on the side if it detects there isn't one, but trying to find where these things are in each app can get annoying. Again I am running CM with Menu button on my Virtual bar, but most of the time I have expanded desktop with LMT launcher(which is just Pie control in app form) on... that allows me to have other apps in short cut when I bring it up.Speaking of Virtual navigation... it does take up considerable amount of screen like I said above, most ROMs will give your ability to get rid of it or make it smaller. Paranoid Android ROM is great at this, but Battery life needs to be sacrificed a bit to use it.TLDR : I can be THE BEST PHONE EVER, IF your adventurous enough to use Custom ROMs and Kernels. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 19:46:48	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

64801151	Got this phone after a series of combinations of phones, pdas and phone / pda combos tried and tested over the period of past couple of years.  (O2 Xda II, I-mate Jam, Nokia N90, Nokia N80 - just to name a few).  As I had read the reviews stating software problems and bugs the first thing that I did was to load the SE PC software in my computer and then hooked up the phone for a software upgrade. The process takes a bit of time but its pretty automated and even someone with basic computing / IT skills can do it easily.  I have used the phone now for over a month after updating the software and have tried out each and everything, like working with multiple applications at a time, playing games while taking calls and so and so forth.  There have been not lags, no crashes, no restarts! Its working great.Everyone knows about the features this baby has.  For me screen crispness and resolution is also very important.  My last gadget was SE K800i.  Although the screen sharpness of P990 does NOT match up with K800i but it is not far behind as well.In my opinion, P990i is the best phone / PDA combo on the market right now.  Very neatly designed (like its predecessors) for heavy phone / SMS users and for serious PDA users as well.Very well balanced, extremely feature rich, good form factor, nice screen, great connectivity options (WiFi, Bluetooth etc).  If you are out for a combination device, look no further. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 19:49:13	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	Upgrade	Operating System	Software		false

It is by far my favorite phone and, man, what a huge upgrade it is from Nokia C6!I'm not going to comment on all the tech specs as this phone is already half-outdated (released at the end of 2010 I believe) in today's tech standards.  The touch screen is extremely responsive yet not overly sensitive.  User interphase takes a moment to adjust to for a Nokia user, but it's fairly easy  friendly once you lay your hands on it.  Picture quality is superb, though I am yet to try out how it works with the flash light (many phone cameras are doomed with taking poor quality pictures when using flash light).  Processor speed is very good - most apps can be downloaded  fully installed within 30 secs (of course, also depends on your connection speed).With all my praises for this phone, I do find a few things that bug me:- battery life: so short.  This is my first HTC but I heard it's a common HTC problem.  But, 75% left after 3 hours of AIRPLANE mode w/ hardly any usage or 85% left after two hour with 3G on but no activities?  This phone would never last an 8-hour day with moderate usage.- sloppy design of the battery lid: feels cheap and very hard to take off  put back.  Every time I do so I feel like I am going to break that little poor piece of plastic.  This bugs me a lot.- poorly designed lid for the SIM card  micro SD card slot: the phone looks perfectly smooth out of the box.  BUT, once you insert a SIM card and put the lid/cover back, the SIM card creates a bump, and the phone is no longer perfectly flat.  Doesn't bother me that much, but HTC should be ashamed of this silly design.  Are they expecting people to use this phone solely as a portable wifi device without a SIM card???- Position  design of the camera: without a phone cover, the way the camera sticks out is doomed for scratches.- Doesn't come with a factory screen protector sheet: ALL cellphones I've purchased brand new, whether the traditional ones (i.e. non-smart) or smart ones, even flip phones, came with a screen protector sheet that can be easily peeled off.  I tend to keep those on for as long as I possibly can as I find them effective enough for protecting my screen.  This phone is the first that came w/o one.  I'm quite disappointed because they fail to provide such little things that cost them literally NOTHING all for the greed of making extras (or in favor of merchants lower in the food chain) from the side products.Overall, pleasant to use but falls short on many little things.  For all its pluses, I still gave it a four star, but it really is closer to a 3.5. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 19:51:19	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

64962681	Well as some say it, I agree. This phone is for people who like tweaking with setting. I guess is for the more technically inclined. Yes the forums make it easier to set up your phone completely. I had no problems with my phone at all. I also installed Opera Mini browser. I was not too pleased with the keyboard.

65951134	I had this phone for 2 weeks and thought it was great. I enjoyed the camera, but the touch screen was very sensitive. I bought the protective case and my phone had dropped to the floor, about a 2 feet drop, and instantly the touch screen stopped working. There isn't a scratch or ding on the phone...it wasn't a hard fall at all. I have dropped other cell phones numerous times even where the battery comes flying out, and those falls all still worked. I called Samsung and of course there is nothing they can do for me except charge me an arm and a leg to fix it. So now I have a 2 week old phone that doesn't work.

71604279	OK, the phone is fine. Google did an amazing job in their android 4.3.My phone fall, and this was the result -&gt; [...]The whole screen is damaged, and I have to replace it, that not the issue.I called LG to ask for a replacement part, they told me they don't sell it to the customers. They have only a repair service, ok, could you tell me how much it will cost? I told him, I told him also it's a broken screen, they will need just to replace it. the rep said, no, you will have to send it first, then we will tell you how much it will cost.Now, if you look for a screen replacement on ebay, the cheapest one cost 100 dollar. That's a really expensive if you compare it with iphone screens. iPhone screen cost only 30 dollar, this one is 100 dollar, and that's a cheapest one. Some sellers sell it for 300 dollar.If you think you will get a service from LG, you are wrong.

65985890	The big problem is it freezes.  Screen goes blank - lit up actually, but blank - and stays that way until you power it off and on again.  While it's frozen, no calls can be received - it is completely nonfunctional, but ... and this is the good part (sarcasm) the battery goes dead within a matter of minutes.  So, you've got a freshly charged battery, which normally would last for 3 or 4 days (depending on usage), and you head out, and take out your phone and ... surprise ... frozen, or worse, battery completely dead.  If it was frozen, the amount of battery life left will depend on how long it was frozen.My wife has the same phone and doesn't have this problem, but I've read complaints from others who do.  Replacing the sim card doesn't help. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 20:02:08	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Internal Hardware		false

66493480	I bought a windows phone this week and I must say that I was literally amazed by its speed and its touch and feel due to the rubber back that allows you to grip it very well. I took the black and white version that I liked much more than the blue.  I was amazed by its simplicity and above all for its cleanliness installing the application and then how easy you find them again, I really like the system to tiles that is much better on a mobile phone on a PC. The battery lasts more than a day with intensive use with push notifications and wifi always on. The only drawback may be the only 4 GB of storage space although for photos videos and music you can use a sd card. For me this thing is not a big problem, since I don't use maps or play with games. I installed eighty applications and space is almost full, but for what I need is really fantastic. In my opinion much better in terms of use of any Android. I'm really super satisfied. And last thing when you hear the music in the headphones is really another music thanks to Beats Audio. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 20:06:14	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

65534817	Let me start off by saying this phone is great. But why give it one star if you're saying its great you might ask? I'll start with the good. Everything....everything about this phone is excellent. The screen, the interface, the features (knock on is something I'm going to miss). The volume and power button moved to the back really wasent that big of an issue, I got used to the location really quick.You can read lots of reviews about the phone being great on here, but now for the one negative that has caused me to get one replacement and made the decision to just completely return it and wait for the Galaxy S5. The Reception is AWFUL. Plain and simple. Do a quick google search and you will find lots of threads and posts across the internet of #34;phone nerds#34; like myself sharing their experiences with this issue. I read one story of someone having 3 phones before giving up on this. I have spoken to sprint twice now and gotten different responses both times. They are even sending me an Air Rave to try and correct the problem. Well the air rave only boosts your signal at home not everywhere. So what the issue exactly is, is that under anything but full bars for service I get severe digital distortion that makes calls practically inaudible. Also, even worse with both phones now EVERY SINGLE CALL IVE RECEIVED has gone straight to voice mail due to poor reception. And this is NOT a sprint problem in my area because I upgraded from an HTC EVO 4G LTE (which wasent that #34;great#34; of a phone to begin with) and i never once experienced calls going straight to voice mail or extreme levels of distortion in my daily calling area in the almost two years ive had it. It comes down to a bad design IMO where unless you have stellar service you might be plagued with this issue. I love this phone, i really do. But the call clarity is the deal-breaker for me. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 20:07:51	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	bad reception	false
65258648	I bought this phone and had it for over a year, then it was stolen a week ago. I was pretty bumped, I loved that phone. Needs to be protected in order for it to last impeccable. Beautiful design, specially in the back part. One thing I dont like its that it is a phone powered by google, needs to have something trackable, dont know a serial chip (im not very technological), but oh well, life goes on.

66941111	I had the phone for a month then I couldn't get on Twitter or Facebook.  I must have called a dozen times to get it fixed but they couldn't resolve it. I loathe to call Virgin Mobile because usually I would get someone in India with a very heavy accent  difficult to understand. Internet is not easy to use on the touch screen and is usually slow. Now the texting isn't working, but that lasted for a year.  The camera on the phone is crap.

65926584	I bought this to see if it would end up being cheaper than a contract phone, and because I figured I could use it as a music player, etc. As a phone, it is surprisingly useful for the price. And I appreciate being able to get (slow but functional) internet access without a $20/month fee.I am disappointed in the memory card slot... Someone posted in a review that it would take a 32GB memory card, however this is absolutely not true. It is 4 GB max. Not exactly going to hold much of anything. This kills half of it's utility for me.In short, if this were priced higher, it would be a 2 to 3 star phone. But for $55 (phone plus 200 minutes card) using coupons and the included triple minutes deal, you get 5 months of use plus 650 minutes. Definitely an inexpensive way to have a phone around if one doesn't talk a lot. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 20:15:29	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false
26251195	I overall like this device, which I switched to from iPhone 4. The bigger screen size seems a bit odd at first, but it grows on you fast, and pretty soon I couldn't imagine going back to the smaller iPhone 4 display.The processor and memory are pretty fast, no complaints there. I like the fact that it boasts a file system, so it's possible to save files and email them later on for example. It also has the ability to open, edit, and save MS Office files, which is great. Google Talk works nicely too, compared to iOS where third party for fee apps just don't seem to be able to cut it.On the downside, the speaker phone volume is lower than other mobile devices I've used. And battery life, while not bad, is not great; practically one has to charge it in full before stepping out of the house, and usually plug it back in first thing upon coming back. I read reviews saying the screen is fragile, but so far it's worked fine for me (have had it for a couple of weeks). 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 20:15:29	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false
65475049	I had the phone for a about a week or so and happened to have it in hand when I had a moment of clarity. I was looking down at the phone, getting a feel for it(admiring mostly) when it dawned on me; I have a Star Trek communicator in my hand. How cool is that? One, phones go in pockets. If your complaining that movies seem small on your phone you should be taken out back and re-educated, of course they are small it's a fracking phone. Complaining about the menu opening in half a second you might as well be saying your diamond shoes are too tight or the air conditioning is too cold(which is a real problem the irony is not lost on me but that's why we have blankets and/or more clothes, it's not rocket science people). Sorry for digressing..I've always wanted to say that. The review that best speaks to this phone was posted by someone who's name started with an L (for the life of me I can't remember where I read it, could of been the bay or some phone forum somewhere, I read a lot of them before buying)they said this phone is for people who want to get *#*$ done. I couldn't agree more, that's the essence, reviews don't get any better than that, and for that reason the phone is perfect. Yes the battery life sucks....you get one day. From morning to evening that's it.  Sure you can squeeze the juice a little bit here and there but personally I don't like seeing numbers in the 30-40% range somehow I equate that with being unprepared.  Alas, I haven't run in to a smart phone yet that shouldn't be charged every night but maybe that's just me. Luckily built in wireless charging is AWESOME and it's a shame that no other consumer products have adopted it (well the toothbrush people...they seem to get it. Which if I worked in some ultra cool lab somewhere or was management of said lab would be saying THE TOOTHBRUSH people get it for $# sake! WTF is wrong with you people? Then I would be told to go sit in the corner.........again while listening to how we just can't afford the extra $1.20 for wireless charging, jet fuel doesn't pay for itself. In conclusion the HP Veer is for the people that get it of course it's not for everyone, nothing is...to all the engineers, developers, and people who worked on this and other Web Os products...thank you.  It is a sad day when your product has been regulated to the Arrested Development of tech; but then again we managed to bring that back..........end of rant/end of line. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 20:15:29	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

I was anxious to dump my.iphone 4 and was all set to.get the HTC DNA, but realized in the store  that the DNA is a beast,much too big to carry around so thats when I stumbled on this little gem from LG, i went home and did some research. Yes the spectrum II IS ONLY dual core and has less internal storage and a smaller screen than some new smartphones but it has all the makings of a super great smartphone nonetheless: zippy performance, great build quality and a unique look. The spectrum II wont be confused for any other phone with the exception of the sony xperia ( maybe). I believe its unique shape helps set it apart from the rest. The screen is one of the best in the industry, abeit not as clear as vibrant as the nexus but much better than the iphone 4s and even the 5 in my opinion. I have had no issues with connecting to wifi or 4G, and syncing to my car's bluetooth was easy, as was connecting to my wireless air printer. Get yourself the Spectrum II you will be pleasantly surprised what this underdog is capable of.  The recent jellybean update was pushed to the phone and downloaded without any issues! Im glad I traded my iphone 4 for Spectrum Ii. The only caveat so far, is not with the phone per se, but with the lack of a good quality accessories, meaning the selection of cases available.for this phone is small. I purchased a rubberized case to temporary protect the phone until find something better. Get the spectrum you will NOT be disappointed but rather impressed. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 20:24:15	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64159440	I'm going to make this review short and sweet. First off, I simply love this phone and is the best smart phone I've ever owned. It's smokin' fast and multitasks like no ones business. The interface is very user friendly and navigating around is a cinch. The only reason I gave this four stars rather than five was for the camera.  Don't get me wrong, it takes good pictures but for a 13 megapixel camera it should take incredible pictures that blow even the Iphone cameras out of the water and that it does not. Other than the that this phone simply rocks.  Quit thinking about it and get it! 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 20:33:53	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Camera		false

65275637	I really enjoyed the phone when I first got it! It's great, it has a spacious keyboard which is great for texts and I really like the swivel screen. I would recommend the sidekick data plan because without it the phone isn't very fun (I don't have the data plan).The problems I had with the phone was that it's a little too big which is inconvenient at times, there's no touchscreen, and you can't customize the main screen with personal photos only the themes they give you. The phone is also a little outdated, it's a 2009 model so guaranteed it's going to be a little old. In a world where smartphones dominate, this sidekick has no touch screen and is not thin and small enough to fit in a pocket. It's a little bulky. I wish I would've looked into the size of the phone first.For the price, this is an awesome phone but if you want a phone that will last a long time I suggest a newer phone or model.No problems otherwise with the phone itself, calls are fine and quality is good. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 20:36:16	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Enclosure		false

65996659	Overall I would give this phone 3 stars. Unfortunately it would turn off by itself constantly even when the battery was fully charged. The only way that I could get it back on would be to remove and then reinsert the battery. The touchscreen would freeze several times daily which also could only be resolved by removing and then reinserting the battery. This phone has excellent features but crashes way too often and by that I mean DAILY! If it weren't for those issues, I would've been very pleased with this phone. Overall, most other functions worked well. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 20:38:37	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	Other	Hardware	Internal Hardware	taking out and then reinserting battery was the soltuion for screen freezing.	false

Secondly, it does not have enough phone storage use. Is there an app that I can download that will give me more storage space? I would like to find a free app, but if it is worth it to pay I will.

64244488	Hi,I brought 'Google Nexus One Unlocked Phone with Android--U.S. Warranty (Brown)' from this seller. Right after few days of buying my phone started hanging when I used to talk. It continued for some days. I did the factory reset and it got fine but again started.  Then the headphone stopped working. I tried to manage even without headphone. Then slowly a new problem started - The phone started giving trouble while charging. It continued for few days and then it does not charge at all. I tried all different chargers. But it is not charging. I spent almost $300 for the phone and it did not even last for 5-6 months. I am not rough user of phone. My uses are hardly 20-30 minutes each day. But then also it did not last. I am disappointed.I don't want to give bad feedback and spoil somebody's name but at the same time I do not want people to spend money on bad products. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 20:46:44	Complaint	Unable to Use	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

66826139	I purchased this phone last July 2011 and the power button is broken.  I followed the instruction and shipped back to HTC for repair.  HTC claimed Amazon is not authorize dealer and need to charge 60 dollars.  I called Amazon and they said it should be manufacturer warranty (HTC), but since Amazon is not authorize dealer and HTC denied the claim.FOR YOUR REFERENCE, ALL THE INFORMATION BELOW means NOTHING since Amazon is not authorize dealer (HTC repair department told me).  Very disappointed.  And the phone is sold directly from Aamzon.com LLC directly!--------------------------------------http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200355910--------------------------------------Nexus One Warranty InformationReturns and warranty: WarrantyHow long does the warranty cover the phone?Your warranty coverage depends on where you live:European Union: the warranty coverage extends twenty-four (24) months from the date of original purchase.All other locations (including the United States): the warranty coverage extends twelve (12) months from the date of original purchaseWhat kind of things are NOT covered by the warranty?The warranty does not cover physical damage to the surface of your Nexus One, including but not limited to cracks or scratches on the screen or camera lens. The warranty also does not provide coverage for issues related to third-party applications you've installed. What kind of things can void the warranty coverage?Here are a few examples of actions that void the warranty coverage:rough handling of the deviceexposure of the device to extreme conditionstampering with the device, including removal or defacing of the serial number, IMEI number, or water indicatorunauthorized opening or repair of the devicetampering with or short-circuiting the batteryunlocking the bootloader using the fastboot programFor a complete list, refer to the warranty card included with your Nexus One and also available below. How does the warranty process work?HTC offers two options for the warranty process:Device swap: The device swap is the quickest way to get a working phone again. A new device will be sent to you, together with a box for returning the defective device. You should remove the SIM card, the battery, and the microSD card from the defective phone, insert them into the new device, and return the defective phone in the box provided.If you have engraved your phone with a personal message, the device that you receive will not include the engraving, and the engraving on the defective device will not be sent back to you. If you want to keep your engraving, you can opt for the express repair option.Express repair: With this option, you send the defective device to the HTC service center. HTC will perform the repair and send you back your device, including the original engraving.How can I initiate a warranty repair?The first step is to request a ticket number by calling HTC, the number for which can be found in the Service  Repair section of the HTC website. An HTC representative will guide you through the process and either (a) arrange for the delivery of the swap device or (b) send you shipping instructions to an email address you provide (if you prefer the express repair model).What happens if I send my device for warranty repair, and it turns out the defect is not covered by the warranty?If the HTC service center detects that the device is not covered by the warranty, an HTC representative will contact you to determine what to do next. You can choose to pay for the repairs (the HTC representative will provide you a quote), or you can opt to have HTC send you back the device, in which case your credit card will be charged the round-trip shipping fees, as well as an examination fee of $28. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 20:46:44	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Enclosure	power button is broken.	false

64510983	-Very problematic order from MileHigh Wholesale. Do not order from them.-Issues with company failure to fulfill my 1 day shipping order. item will arrive in 4 days, not 1 day.-Company webstore states they Ship in Colorado, package tracking info shows it is shipped from NY.-Company changed name from ET Hydrophonics to MileHigh Wholesale Inc. in CO.-Very upset that I selected this company from CO specifically so that my item arrives here in CALI asap bec. they were closer to CALI. but they are shipping the item all the way from New York.====================Now for the product review. I decided to stop by at an ATT store and purchased their Galaxy Mega 6.3.The phablet is very nice and quite portable. In terms of usability, it handles most app launches and background task without any hesitation. I noticed a very slight stutter from an HD 1080P video from Vimeo but it was hardly noticeable.I'm a hardware engineer and I think this would complement my work and entertainment consumption with just one gadget instead of separate units. As far as pocketability, It is possible to contain it inside a standard straight leg jeans. It could pose difficulty for someone having those skinny jeans and or silicone rubber cases due to the friction they create.I would definitely purchase another for someone in my household because of its double duty purpose. In addition, I'm a long time iOS user and this is my first time using an Android OS. So far, it is very impressive and quite user-friendly. Very happy with my ATT store purchase.Good: Good battery life, replaceable battery, pretty good screen, cpu is average,Not so good: slippery to holdBad: NO LTE support for Verizon or SprintI will add more info as I use the phablet 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 21:02:03	Neutral	Other	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Enclosure	size and texture makes it difficult to carry in pocket.	false

65514530	It works. It's snappy.  I used it in the rain. It didn't come filled with bloat ware. Speaker works well.  Only reason not a 5-star rating is the poor quality of close-in pictures taken by the camera,  since I have used my previous phone camera to copy documents. If I find a workaround for that, or if I come to discover that it's operator error, then a 5 star. 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 21:08:27	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Camera		false

65967960	The phone is just okay and lacks so many features that are possible now days. Does have some that are very good for the money.By that I mean, I have a Motorola W376G and it has a radio built in. Also has a flip cover which this does not. This has the ability to record voice, but does not have the ability to do so easily... or record a call in the middle of it... at least that I found.What it does have is the ability to transfer pictures from you phone without mailing them but for free using a USB cord (not included but cheap at many stores). But sadly it is only a 1.3 megapixel camera.Now it does have a huge amount of storage 4gb on a microSD card (also not included but cheap on amazon) so you can use it to carry important pictures, documents, sound files etc which you can put on through the USB cord from your computer.The instruction manual that comes with it is very poor.The right sellers have cheap minutes you can buy for the camera with some great deals every now and then.Last year Tracfone had some special that doubled my minutes (right around Christmas) and took my user active functioning date to the year 2072!The lack of being a flip phone is the part that bothers me the most. As is the lack of a radio. Also, having a stylus would be nice to work the small keys, but again you can buy them here on Amazon.On the good side is the ability to transfer pictures from the camera to your computer for free without sending them (at a minutes cost).This tracfone also does not have any smartphone features or the ones it does have are minimal.. at least not up to so many other phones on the market.But the price is so great it does make up for the features and functions it lacks. So overall not a terrible buy.Oh, but one major bad feature is Tracfone tech support. It is slow and terrible and very few of their techs speak good English so it is hard to get through even minor calls with any speed. My fone came in in Spanish and it took 3 Hours to get tech support (5 different techs) to understand what I wanted to do.... make it display in English. When I finally got a tech who understood what I needed to do it to about 2 minutes.Also watch out for the Internet button (on the front beside the other buttons and clicking it by accident (easy to accidentally do as it is also the ON/OFF button and depends what other buttons are already pushed) costs you at least 1.5 minutes!!!!.I have had other tracfones and got thru using them easily. This has been a chore so far.3 hours of my life to change the language(plus more time looking functions up online with my computer) have bothered me about this phone.My W376G is a blessing (yes I still have two of them). Considering all this, this phone which will only ever be a back up phone... but that will cost minutes too ... :-( oh well.// it was cheap and the seller was good too! 	jakeg6	10-26-2015 21:28:27	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		false

65912036	So far, several months into using the HTC Sensation 4G Android Phone (T-Mobile), I'm pleased. As this is my first smartphone, I was concerned about how fast 4G really is as it relates to different apps. Faster is always better, but this is a fantastic start.It is difficult to separate the device from the apps. I have been careful only to download name brand apps, avoiding the nastiness that happens when downloading some unknown company's tool.I have a couple Gmail accounts coming through with ease. Internet use has been trouble free, and especially good when sites are mobile-ready. Netflix works well, though their updates can be dodgy, but that's a Netflix problem. LinkedIn, Peep, YouTube, Google Doc, Google Translate, TuneIn Radio, Spotify are all good here. Kindle is slow to load, but it gets the job done. How good is Angry Birds? I don't want to talk about it. I'm addicted.The camera shots and video have all been impressive, though the sound pick-up with the video is sometimes slightly off. I use the camera daily.Things are fast, clean, and only occasional freezes. I'm a happy customer, looking forward to the next generation.

66278147	Well, It is a bit hard to me to compare 8900 with other BB, since it is the first one I've got, however I can certainly describe my experience with it, so far:regarding the functionality of the device: I consider it is well thought, and even better built smartphone: everything works the way it is supposed to. I'm happy with its QWERTY keyboard: no touchscreen can replace a sensation to press a button...Hardware: so far so good. everything seems to be just fine: GPS works fine, Camera: I was expecting a bit more... the picture quality isn't very good under low light conditions... but it is acceptable.Software: a lot, from BB Apps World, but mostly useless, in addition, RIM pretends to authorize them up to USD1500 when you open you BB Apps World account... I think it is unacceptable... hehehehe I remember what happened to Lisa Simpson, when she got her iPod... so I better keep the distance.If you mean to use your BB for business, it has enough, maybe, you will need a pdf reader. the rest depends on your pesonal preferences.BB Messenger: deserves a couple of words. it is good, but has some serious, even fatal issues: it is impossible to block a contact: only remove, so the person will realize, at once if you do so... I think it is unconfortable...Messenger notifies the sender when the message is delivered and read by the user.... so no excuse to no answer... very awful detail. They should think about it...BB Maps: completely useless in my country (Colombia), the solution was the google maps.One thing that really disappointed me, was impossibility to use Skype... really bad trick. I'm going to purchase 3rd part application, in order to fix this (about usd40).Performance: mostly works perfectly. at some moments it may become a bit slow, thinking about something..., it could take a couple of seconds... nothing serious. (I remember when i had an ETEN smartphone, which I had to restart 2 times a day, in order to be able to use it)... the rest is just fine: no lockups, or any type of glitches...In order to resume all this: I consider that 8900 is a good mid-range BB, equipped with good features (GPS, Bluetooth, 3MP camera with flash), with very few flaws (at least in my case), so I think it was a good choice. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:00:27	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

36885450	I've had this phone since mid-November. Windows 8 is very easy to learn and works well. Internet surfing is exceptionally fast, especially when on wifi or 4G. It also seems to be durable, having dropped it twice while standing. Both times the battery and cover flew off but putting it back together it worked fine. I would subtract a half star for thickness and weight if possible. Additionally the screen is bright and clear and the camera works great under most conditions, lacking a bit in low light as most small digital cameras seem to. Battery - twice since I've owned it I've run out of battery during the day after quite a bit of game playing/web surfing so that seems good to me. Haven't experienced any functionality problems.

64240638	I got my phone brand new 100 unlocked as I expected... I'm rating 4 stars for three reasons:1. the wall charger came with 2 plug ins to complete the charger... way too impractical...!Otherwise it came with the CD, USB cable, brand new battery, and a 2gb micro SD etc...2. NO HEADPHONES!3. If you're going to get a data plan with the phone... get it... if you're planning to use this with a wifi connection... don't... the browser and the download speed sucks... even when your wifi network works fine on other devices...despite all that.. the phone is great! and I bought it really cheap here... amazon was the seller... $170!!! 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:16:44	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

I am facing a problem with this phone is that it some time don't receives the incoming calls and directly goes to voice mail and even will not show the incoming calls in the miss call . you have to turn off  again turn on the phone to make it able to receive the incoming call and due to this inactive phase you can miss your important calls.this problem is upsetting me and I am confused whether to keep the phone or return it .If any one has solution for this will be appreciated. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:19:02	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

66803926	Hands down it's lovely phone hardware wise and the OS runs well on it, but Windows Phone 7 lacks a lot.Bluetooth is a joke. It is there so that when you are looking at the details you would see it has Bluetooth but what you don't see is that it only works with headsets. (Will not work with my car Pioneer CD-BTB200 Bluetooth Wireless Adapter) You cannot send a file to another phone or transfer a file to or from your PC. You have to email or send it to Skydrive. On top of that, you have to use Internet Explorer to access your Skydrive account to access the file. You cannot just open Office and access the file unless you go online.To get your contacts on, you have to upload them to your hotmail or windows live account. It does not sync with Outlook, you have to setup your outlook to access you live account and copy your contacts to that account. (How many companies want that kind of data sitting on Hotmail)You can only install programs you have purchase from Marketplace. Not that nice app you made to do interoffice stuff.Every day I use this phone I find more things I dislike with the OS.Microsoft should soon be putting out an update which should allow copy and paste. On less this update really make some changes to this OS other than copy/pace I will be looking at cracking this phone and installing another OS (WP7 cooked or Android). I will not put up with this after spending this kind of money on a phone.Just found out that hotmail/live contacts is limited 1000. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:19:02	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

66714494	The T-Mobile G2x (or in other countries, the LG Optimus 2x) has kind of a troubled history.  It launched with FroYo (in spring 2011, no less, which is pretty crummy) and it wasn't exactly a solid phone.  Lots of trouble reported around the web with lock-ups and freezes and random rebooting and so on and so on.  I don't doubt any of that stuff.I got this phone right after 2.3.3 released last summer.  It wasn't exactly stellar, but it was good enough. I experienced a very rare random reboot and very occasional lock-up.  Super rare, and not necessarily an indicator of the software.  Still, reports of that behavior abound on the internet with the 2.3.3 Gingerbread update.And then in April, LG/T-Mobile released a 2.3.4 update.  And wowza.  Totally solid phone.  In the 2 months since the update, I have never experienced a crash.  I don't believe I had any random reboots, though I guess it might have done it in the middle of the night.  Never once during the day when I was using it or needed it.  I'm finally really impressed.  So let's quit talking about software and get to hardware.The screen is the first thing you'll notice, and it's gorgeous.  4, 800x480 resolution, IPS display.  IPS is one of the higher-quality LCD technologies out there, with very wide viewing angles, accurate color reproduction, and bright backlights.  It has all of that.  The screen, in fact, is what sold me on this phone in the first place. The body is sturdy and solid-feeling, as well.  The screen is covered in glass, there's a metalic trim on the sides, and a soft-touch rubberized plastic battery door.  The volume/power buttons are solid and tactile, and pressing them is easy without being out of control.  It has 2 cameras, one front-facing (which is good enough for skype) and a really nice 8MP camera on the back with LED flash.  Pictures are great, you know, for a phone.  It replaced my Nikon point-and-shoot 8MP camera since the photos are basically the same to my eyes, but if you want dSLR quality, get a dSLR.  Duh, it's a phone.After that is the engine running this ship, an nVidia Tegra 2 SoC and 512MB of RAM.  The Tegra 2 is as fast as any other 1GHz dual-core CPU, and the ultra-low-voltage GeForce GPU is quite sufficient for all your gaming wants and needs.  Where it falls a little short is the 512MB of RAM.  Occasionally if an app runs wild, the phone will sputter.  Zynga's games are the worst offenders I've found; Words and Scramble both use around 40MB when they're idle.  Totally unacceptable, honestly, and because they dont' get along with the phone I removed them.  If the phone had 768MB of RAM (like the MyTouch 4G and MyTouch 4G Slide) it'd be a different story, or if it had 1GB like the Motorola Atrix (the other Tegra 2 phone that came out in early 2011) it'd be a total non-issue.  512MB of RAM is plenty most of the time, though.The phone has 8GB of storage total, with 1.45GB partitioned off for app storage (which is plenty), 3.7GB set aside as the SD Card (internal storage), and the rest eaten up by Android's system, cache, and boot partitions.  So 5.25GB of space available to the user, and a micro SD slot that supports micro SDHC cards, so you can have another 32GB of space if you so choose.  My phone came with an 8GB SD card for a total of 16GB of storage, but if you buy used I would not count on getting that bonus.Call clarity is great.  The speaker gets relatively loud before it distorts.  I can hear people well, they can hear me well, and that's either using the handset or the speaker phone.  It has Bluetooth but i have not used it.  It also has micro-HDMI output for playing videos or games on your TV, and the phone came with a cable, but I have not made use of it yet.The phone has been discontinued but it's well worth getting. Finally.  The only way you're going to get nicer off-contract is to spend twice as much money on a MyTouch 4G Slide, or even more on a Galaxy S II or HTC One series phone.  I can't say enough.  I'm using it with the $30/month Monthly 4G pre-paid plan (I don't need more than 100 cell phone minutes, but I want the data coverage and Android OS).  Cell network speeds in my area are fast enough - this gets the same bandwidth in the same places as my wife's LG Optimus T, which varies anywhere from 6.8mbit to next-to-nothing out in the middle of nowhere.  Dropped calls are a non-issue with the phone. Reception si as good as my old phone (a cheapy java phone) or my wife's phone.I think that covers it.  It gets an unqualified thumbs-up from me as of mid-April 2012.  Previously it might have been a little hesitant, but I'm glad I've stuck with it. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:25:51	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

Movies look great and there is plenty of screen real estate for everything.#8226; I love that accessory manufacturers are now recognizing that the iPhone isn't everything. There's a ton of stuff available for this thing.#8226; The battery really is impressive. Full day of HEAVY usage doesn't phase it. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, mobile data, movies, web browsing, games. Doesn't matter.Cons:#8226; Everyone commenting on how big it is. Fits in my pocket, doesn't feel huge. Other phones feel tiny now.Other thoughts:#8226; Might be a niche product, but I don't need two devices any more. I barely even use my computer now.#8226; Best phone I've ever had! 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:25:51	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
66488075	The LG Optimus G Pro is a well-rounded device, despite it's software quirks. I'm not saying the phone is slow by any means, in fact it is very responsive, but I am saying that LG's skin for Android is a bit messy at times.  I am a fan of stock Android, and like to install roms such as Cyanogenmod or AOKP if the device does not ship with stock. Unfortunately, the development for the G Pro is somewhat non-existent.  For the average user though, the phone is great and I recommend it. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:25:51	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

64412828	I have had this phone less than a year.  I have had it replaced two times so far and have, the whole time I have owned it, not had a full month of this phone working properly.  Right out of the box the first time it had speaker problem and did not ring.  The next time people would call me and not be able to hear me, but I could hear them.  The main reason I picked it was because it has a camera.The camera could be better, but for the price, is not too bad.  The phone does go through power very quick.  Any day I talk on it I have to charge it.Although I have had many tech problems with this phone, it seems to be strong physically, nothing on it has broken, including the screen on the front.  It also has a nice sized color screen.So if you buy this phone, just make sure you keep up the insurance and keep track of your warrenty info because it will need to be replaced. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:28:30	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	Replacement	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

50778257	I bought this phone for one thing - to make phone calls with an unlocked quadband phone overseas.  I have not traveled with it, but I'm assuming it can handle the phone call portion fine.  It is the rest of the package that is irritating.BLU made some seriously strange decisions.There is no dedicated volume rocker, to change the volume of the ringer or call, but it can play music and has a flashlight.  To use either of these options you need to scroll though a long list of options.The hardware seems fine, but the software is out of Motorola circa 1999.Is it worth $25, hell yes!Do I like this phone - no way.Would I recommend it to someone else for $25- certainly.Do I wish someone made a $25 phone that was easy to use... dearly. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:28:30	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Features	Internal Hardware		false
40121270	I love the Windows 8 OS and much has been said about it in previous reviews, but what I am struck with is just how much money you can save by owning the Lumia 920The camera is excellent so you can sell your shoot and snap camera. The video is really clear and very stable, so no need for a video camera anymore unless you are buying a high end one. The offline GPS does not use any data from your plan so you can get rid of your Sat Nav. I don't need my sports GPS watch anymore for jogging. Nokia music has loads of free music so you can ditch your Spotify subscription. I have the Xbox music subscription that syncs seamlessly with my laptop and Xbox, so I am saving loads of money on buying CD's. I'm using Kik Messenger for sending all my photos to friends rather than sending them via text.I don't have kids, but all my friends have stories of kids spending money in the apps stores on their phones, now with Kids Corner that will not be possible. Not to mention all the apps I can find deals locally on and have them show up straight to my home page live tiles.Nokia regularly have apps that are free only to their phones. You can use the phone wearing gloves so you don't need to spend money on special conductive gloves in the winter. There's probably more that I have forgotten too.I am a huge fan of the Nokia Lumia 920Edit note: I have corrected a couple of auto correction spelling errors 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:30:58	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65130149	I've used a few of the budget Sony smartphones before and felt they were a bit lacking in a few key areas (screen quality and not as quick as I wanted processor wise) The older Xperia E was not as good as it should have been (in my view)The Xperia E1 is much improved in some respects and running Android 4.3 out of the box, though it's not the last word in budget phones it's worth looking at.My quick summary of the good and bad...Pros:+ 1.2 GHz Qualcomm MSM8210 dual-core, this is good enough for most users and doesn't suffer the lag of the older E, it's pretty snappy+ Screen is vastly improved in every respect, larger, higher resolution, more colours and better contrast+ The sound is good, Sony make a big deal out of the xLOUD speaker and it's not hype it's pretty impressive for a built in speaker (and yes it is loud!)+ Build is ok for this price range, joins and seams are tight with no creaking, though the plastics used could be higher quality+ I had no problems or issues with wifi connection, or call quality and day to day use.+ Fairly well featured for a budget end phone, as usual Sony cater quite well for the entertainment side with their Walkman (which has a dedicated button on the top of the phone - good for music quick playing), Movies app, and sound filters.+ Bluetooth 4.0, aGPS+ Battery Stamina mode, it's not a gimmick it does help (turns off wifi and connections quite aggressive battery management- you can cusomise the notifications) heavy users will need a charge every other day, but lighter ones can go a bit longer.Cons:- 512MB ram ok it's a budget phone, but still Android does like a bit more memory at times- Camera is #34;ok#34; but nothing to get worked up over 3mp no flash, fairly basic passable for snaps. Budget models don't do well here, and the E1 is about average ok in good light not so great low light. Video is basic enough and can be a bit choppy at times too.- While the screen is much improved, the viewing angles could be better, not great in this area- No NFC (becoming more sought after)- No front facing camera, even a basic one would be useful (skype etc)Other information:Micro SD supports up to 32GBThis is the dual sim version, there are single sim ones around tooXperia E1 #34;major#34; improvements v the E+ Screen is now 4#34; v the 3.5#34; on the older model and resolution is much better too (480x800 v 320x480). A lot More colours 16 million v 262k big difference overall+ Dual core processor 1.2GHz v the single core 1 GHz (this is a very obvious in using both handsets the older E is just #34;slow#34;)+ Longer battery life (Sony quote over 8 hours talk time v just over 6 for the E) battery is up to 1750mAh v 1500mAh on the E (but note the screen is bigger) Day to day not a big difference though between the 2 models+ Newer graphics processor Adreno 302 is more able to deal with games and 3d applications over the old one.There are a lot of rivals out there and whilst the E1 doesn't blow the barn doors off spec wise, it does at least bring the older E (which was in my view a bit dated even at launch) up to par. Gone are the laggy slow responses (do bear in mind the ram is only 512MB though) and sub par screen that we had previously wasn't the most convincing offering for a budget Android handset. Games also play quite a lot better on the E1 (it's not top tier by any means but acceptable at this price point)This is a much nicer phone to use, and no doubt will drop a little in price. Worth considering in this price range, where as the older E wasn't really. You can buy the Xperia J which is a bit cheaper in price, but it's only got the single core processor (and like the old E is not a fast handset) There are rivals that have somewhat better screens than the E1 (even though it's improved quite a bit it's a normal TFT not an IPS like the Lumia 520). It's a good choice for heavy music users thanks to the walkman button, good EQ settings and above average sound quality.I'll give it 4 stars and will update the review with any issues/problems over time. Quite a solid offering that's worth consideration. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:30:58	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Features	Camera		false
65048466	I bought the BB q10 from T-mobile. Let me begin by writing down some cons, because there are very few:1. If you use a lot of apps (current iPhone or Android user), this phone will disappoint you. Many apps are not available, or are made by 3rd party companies. But in my opinion, apps are generally overrated and over appreciated. The safest app is always your browser. It guarantees SSL and other security. I should never trust a banking app, for instance. Always, access sensitive accounts through your phone's internet browser.2. Smaller screen than iPhone or the BlackBerry z10. If you are used to watching videos on larger screens, then this phone is not for you. Although, I feel the screen is only about an inch smaller than the iPhone. But the Q10 has greater pixel density (336 dpi vs 330 dpi) than the IPhone 4.That's it! I cannot think of any other drawbacks.The pros:1. The call/voice quality is SUPERB! It is amazing how clear the voice of the person I am speaking with sounds. Just compare it with any phone (iPhone, HTC, etc.).2. There touch screen gestures are very useful: swipe up and left to access your communication HUB is great. Also, the ability to multitask and shutdown unwanted apps are way better than iPhone or android.3. The keyboard is the BEST yet. I can type so fast that it astonishes me. I can type a whole paragraph and not make any typos. The autocorrect/learn is exceptional.4. Finally, ActiveSync is here. So your Microsoft exchange/OWA and IMAP e-mail are fully accessible. You can access contacts, folders and subfolders.5. BlackBerry messenger is absolutely amazing. You can call other BBM users via Wifi and send them text, voice, and other attachments. NO SIZE LIMITS!6. The phone is very responsive. I have used the Q10 for a month now. I never had to wait for the phone to wakeup or reboot. It has never crashed. My wife's HTC android phone does that occasionally.7. Front and back camera is finally here on the BB. You can Skype!8. Expandable memory up to 32 GB.9. More system memory than the iPhone 4 (2048 MB vs 512 MB).10. Finally a note about apps. I mentioned the lack of apps in the cons. But I have all the apps I need: Twitter, YouTube, Maps, GoogleMaps (very good 3rd party build), facebook (that I care less about), Navita Language translator, Pandora (3rd party build), DropBox (3rd party), Box (alternative to DropBox), Skype, Weather, DocsToGo (word, excel, power point), Calculator (incl. scientific), Clock (Alarm/World Time/Stop Watch/Timer), QR/Bar code scanner, scanner/convert photos to PDF app, GasBuddy, Slacker Radio, FourSquare, LinkedIn, and more.If you are a current BB user, please buy the Q10 . It won't disappoint you. If you are first-time smart-phone buyer (or looking to switch from iPhone or Android), please give this phone a try. Most carriers allow at least 14 days returns. I believe you will love it.I shall update my review in a few months time.===Update===The BlackBerry 10 devices can run Android apps. Surprisingly, the process is quite easy. Please visit CrackBerryDOTcom or another BlackBerry user forum for instructions and download the application that lets you do this. I have sideloaded over a dozen Android apps on my Q10. They work just fine.

65010170	Battery time is only a few hours. I am the sort of person who does not use phone very frequqntly or listen to music, watch videos or surf internet over the phone. Still by the team I return home from work, the battery is already dead. The processor is also really slow. I bought it during a promotion and it sat around for a few months before I started using it. Now I'm just past the date that I could have returned it. Don't buy this phone! 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:33:24	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		false
68711140	Update 9/22/13: I am on my 4th Lumia 822 and it works perfectly. Not sure if it's because it's a different phone, or if they fixed the underlying issue, but I am now a happy camper!Old review: DON'T buy this phone if you need your phone to stay on. I bought the Nokia Lumia 822 after having another Nokia phone for about 7 years. It was durable and easy to use, and I never had any problems with it. But I've had problems with the 822 since day 1. It randomly shuts itself off and stays off. The first time it happened, I was late for work because the alarm doesn't work if the phone is off. This happens every 2 nights or so. It also happens during the day. One time, it shut off 3 times within a couple of hours. I couldn't power the phone back on except by taking the back off, removing the battery, counting to 10, and then putting the battery back in. Yesterday, I learned that you can also hold the volume down button at the same time you hold the power button, and you have to hold them both until it powers back on, about 12 seconds. Better than taking the battery out, because when you remove the back of the phone, sometimes several times a day, the back gets loose. I reported the problem immediately to Verizon, and they told me to keep the phone because they were expecting a software update by the end of the following month that would fix it. So I kept it, but when the next month went by and the phone was still not working, I called back to ask what had happened. They said this is a known issue, and they didn't know when it would be fixed. So I asked them to send me a new phone and they agreed to do so, but it was only when we talked about it some more that I found out they were sending me a refurbished phone. I explained that I reported the problem within the 14 day time limit, so I expected a new phone. They said it didn't matter, all they could send me was a refurbished phone. When I got the refurbished phone, they only sent the front half of the phone. You have to use the old battery, SIM card, and phone back. On this phone, we couldn't even get it set up because of error messages, so I returned that the next day. I'm on my third phone now, and it also shuts off. I powered it on for the first time yesterday around noon, and it shut off by 2:00 PM. It shut off last night during the late evening hours, and it shut off again during the night.My recommendations:1) don't buy this phone,2) if you get a phone with a problem and Verizon tells you a software update will fix it soon, don't believe them, and3) if you have ANY problems with a new phone, don't let them talk you into keeping it - return it ASAP and get a new one. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:33:24	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Replacement	Features	Software		false
65169257	This phone is absolutely amazing, but I warn that it is almost too big to be a phone and too small to be a tablet.

66305997	I received my n900 just a few days ago from Nokia USA. For the purposes of this review, I will compare it to my previous phone, the HTC G1. My opinions are solely based on the user experiences in the past days with the n900, and since I've never owned an iphone, I will not compare it to such.Physical layout:*The N900 is a pretty beefy phone, and rightfully so. While having some heft to it, the n900 is solid and well-built. The black metal rim is a nice touch without being too gaudy. The slide is not spring-assisted but gives a nice click upon opening and closing. I have not noticed any creaks or wobbles from the screen. Few have complained about the back being hard to open. Although true, I rather have that with the peace of mind that the battery won't pop out if I dropped it (God forbid)! the n900 is of comparable size to the G1, albeit being slightly thicker, and not a problem for me.*I don't really understand all the fuss about resistive and capacitive screens. The n900's screen is gorgeous and is incredibly brilliant. There is a little 'give' to the screen, but I've yet to have problems with it. The screen is quite responsive and supports kinetic scrolling. I did have some difficulty clicking on small links in the browser, but that's because your index finger isn't exactly the most accurate pointing device. This was easily solved by zooming in (more on that later).*The keyboard is pretty good. It is a different experience coming from the G1 (as you have to type with the 'chin' in the way on your right hand) so naturally, it felt better. The keys have a grippy rubberized texture feel to them, and although the buttons are smooshed next to each other, (like a real keyboard) they have good response. I do miss the 5-row keyboard on the G1, and I don't understand why the n900's screen doesn't open up a bit more. For those with large hands, it might be a little uncomfortable. However, one plus for the n900 is that my thumbs don't have to travel as far to type.*I love that the placement of the speakers are on the sides of the phone, as opposed to the back on the G1. I do a lot of talking on speakerphone, and so I'm not forced to flip it upside down during a call. Sound quality is good and the speakers are decent.Maemo 5/ Software*This is the ultimate customization OS. When they meant open source, they really meant it. The 4 desktops make things a lot easier to navigate. For example, one page is devoted to my common phone contacts, another utility apps, the third has bookmarks to frequent sites (the homepages of those links are previewed on the desktop, fyi), and so forth.*The way Maemo multitasks is ingenious. The overview page where you see all your actively running programs makes navigating between windows and programs very easy and efficient. One thing to note is that you have the ability to close out any of those windows upon your choosing, as opposed to the G1 where the 6 app limit neither allowed to you open more nor shut them down, making it very sluggish, especially during critical times (ie texting someone directions while running gps).*SMS (called conversations in Maemo) is pretty similar to the G1, but has one added step - conversations either in text or IM by the same person are displayed in the same window. The ability to have the other person's contact image in the text box (that is if you set one up for that person) is a nice touch. I personally don't care about MMS, so no gripes there.*The email client is pretty decent, I set up my gmail account with a few simple steps, but it isn't nearly as accessible as the gmail app on the G1. For example, I haven't found a way to delete an incoming email when it first comes in. I have to leave the letter, go into the inbox, back into the email, then delete it.*Browsing experience is comparable to the pc, and is nothing short of awesome. Full flash means I can access full youtube pages, and among others. I think the swirling zoom gesture is pretty neat, and helps me to click on the smaller links. I figured out that using your index to swirl zoom produces the best results. Alternatively, you can double click the screen or use the volume rocker. Going to previous pages not only allows you to go to the last page, but scroll through the entire history of that window. Neat.*Applications-wise, there are not many out there, but I'm certain many will be out soon. You can also access the Maemo repositories for more (google it) but be careful as many of them are still in development and are potentially dangerous to your phone. Noteworthy apps include Hermes (connects your social sites, like facebook to your contacts so you get contact phones, birthdates, etc) and Qik (live streaming recording).Hardware:*Fast, fast, fast. Need I say more?*No hang ups yet, since I can close apps at my own will.*The camera is good, that is for a 5mp phone camera. It will never compare to a dedicated camera, but is more than effective for quick shots to upload on facebook.*The FM transmitter is a great add-on. Now I can share songs without having to look for an aux cable.*Battery life seems to last a little over a day with some text and internet. Wifi is on all the time when I'm at home. My G1 would be down to around 70% by noon.Of course, no phone/mobile device is perfect. Here are some things that came to my attention:*The volume rocker is on the right side (in portrait), meaning it is nearly impossible to use as a zoom when the screen is up. Same goes for the lock switch, which is on the bottom (in landscape). Would have been much better on the sides, as it would be easier to lock after a phone call, for example.*Copy and paste is kinda sporadic. While you can copy all you want on webpages, I couldn't copy a phone number from one contact to another in the phonebook.*The stand is nice, but it swings out way too deep and feels a bit too weak. I'm afraid I'll break it someday.*Little portrait support as of now, but I think it'll be fixed soon.So there you have it. My impressions of the n900. There is still a lot of exploration to be done, but I can honestly say this is the best phone/mobile device I've ever owned. In spite of a few shortcomings, its an amazing piece of technology. A lot of things I didn't mention probably will be fixed within a firmware or two so that isn't a problem. I hope this helps anyone who is on a fence on buying one, good luck! 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:35:38	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

56880096	The Lumia 920 by Nokia is an excellent phone. I've read many bloggers complain about the 920's heft, it does weigh more than I'm used to, but that fact aside, this is an excellent phone. The weight of the phone makes it feel like a premium device. With all the extras and app exclusives that Nokia is offering, this phone is unbeatable especially at the price. The PureView camera is fantastic, especially in low light conditions and the lenses feature is fun and easy to use. The camera is one of if not the best camera I've used on a mobile device. The Windows Phone 8 OS is super speedy and runs without any hiccups or freezing and really allows for excellent customization. The unibody shell and the curved glass fit perfectly together and complement Windows Phone 8 excellently. I highly recommend this phone. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:38:48	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
66092591	I got this yesterday and I don't write many reviews, but this phone merits one immediately. This phone has undoubtedly the most bang for the buck. The price is outrageously cheap for what it offers which is wi-fi, all kinds of business apps, a small but brilliant screen, and on and on. I have had a few Nokias, liked them all, and I have an iPhone which I bought unlocked from HK. Too much money, but what are you gonna do. What I would do now had I to do it over again is buy this one, but it wasn't on my radar screen. The iPhone is great, but I go out of the US often and so bought a Qsim thingie that would let me switch over to another country. It worked ok for a while, although it was not the most handy since it had the other sim cards, normal size, outside the iPhone. It started causing trouble, so I canned it and looked for another phone for the other country. If you do business, this is great. If you do other social stuff, this is great. You will not go wrong with this phone at this price, and Amazon to have it at this price is doing something right. 5 stars. Highly recommend. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:38:48	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64682258	I know that title sounds funny but it's true.  I'm short, only 5'2 so my hands are pretty small.  I purchased this phone when I was due an upgrade since I've always had Verizon and of course needed the latest and greatest.  I absolutely adored the phone; however, I returned it after a couple of days and went back to using my Droid X.  Why you ask if I loved the phone - could not deal with the battery life of the regular battery - only lasted part way through the day with everything turned off and just some playing around and checking my email etc.  I had purchased the extended battery which made the phone last  for ages but it made the phone so big and so heavy that it was uncomfortable for me to use.  Sad as I was, will wait until Motorola figures out how to create a phone battery combination that lasts without having to buy the extended battery.  The size of the extended battery has improved over the HTC but not enough for me to want to pay that much money for a phone that doesn't fit my hand - can you say iPhone? 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:40:16	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Replacement	Features	Software		false
64946741	This phone has an endless list of features. I will not go into the features I have already read on other reviews.- Tethering out of the box with an app included in the phone.- Super fast face detection (focusing and metering)- Very responsive screen- The old composite video cable works on the headphones jack (as well as the HDMI)- It may not have a retina display, but videos seem very crisp and vibrant.- GPS lock and compass calibration was very fast.The things I disliked:- Like everyone else the UI is not state of the art, there is much room for improvement here.- Mail for exchange did not properly work on an initial sync.- The social network app is terrible.Overall the phone is great for techies who love to have many features that are software locked on other platforms. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:40:16	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false
64260680	The S390G is probably Tracfone's most advanced phone to date. It is only one of two Tracfones with 3G capabilities (the other is theSamsung S425G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone)) and is the only Tracfone I know of with Wi-fi capabilities.  To be sure, only those people looking for any sort of data usage, such as web surfing, actually need these features, and Tracfone's data rates are not a good value for those who plan on a lot of 3G web-surfing. If your tastes lie with a cheap phone and you could care less about data, you probably don't need this phone, and if you want to stream YouTube videos and surf Facebook on the go you definitely need a different carrier. However, for those who just need occasional but speedy data access, this is one of the very few ways to get 3G data access for under $10 a month.I've been a Tracfone user for several years now and their phones have been, to put it politely, modest. This phone is not a true smartphone, but it is also not the dumbphones of Tracfone years past. It has decent connectivity options - Bluetooth and in addition to the aforementioned Wi-fi and 3G - and has a few other niceties like a microSD slot (I put a Sandisk 4GB in without trouble), voice activated dialing, a basic but functional camera, a mobile browser that does the job pretty well, and Java app capability that allows for a decent range of add-ons, including the Opera Mini web browser, Facebook, and an assortment of games. Tracfone's site actually sells a few nice games produced by designer Gameloft, including LEGO Batman, for about 50 minutes each. The interface is pretty easy to use, the touchpad and keyboard work well (including a spacebar that is actually two different buttons), and the OS seems to run pretty cleanly. Some have said the screen is too small for web browsing, but that is not my experience; it's Blackberry-sized and works well for the volume of mobile sites now out there.The phone is not perfect. Other reviewers, for example, have debated at length the phone's Wi-fi, with some insisting it doesn't work and others insisting the first lot is wrong. For me, the Wi-fi has proven somewhat temperamental, depending on the router. On my primary router, a Belkin, it at first it did not work at all, and after trying some of the suggestions online (including turning the phone and router off and waiting for a bit), I was able to get it running, although I'm not exactly sure what did it. Even now, though, it goes through bouts where it doesn't feel like connecting to that router. Conversely, I dug up an old Linksys router and that connects without trouble.  Likewise, when I'm out and about some wireless systems connect great and some won't connect at all.The Wi-fi is not a total disappointment - once it connects for me it runs smoothly - but it certainly isn't as flawless as it should be. Assuming you can get it running (be sure to scroll down to the password), the Wi-fi provides a way to play around with the phone without burning up minutes in the process.A couple of side notes about accessories. One, many have lamented the fact that there aren't very many options out there beyond the leather clip/pouch variety, which aren't terribly stylish or compact. After searching a while online, it does seem like this phone is of the same dimensions and design as the Samsung Cha@t 527 (S5270), and it actually has a few silicone and gel skins online, so that may be an option for those who want them. Two, there are car chargers out there but this phone has a micro USB port and will charge on a computer or, on newer stereos and cars, a car USB port.As I said at the outset, this isn't for everyone, but it has its niche. I'm a phone user that mostly has one for emergencies, but there are also those times when I am at a store and need to compare a price on Amazon or I need to find a nearby restaurant. This phone fits that bill perfectly.  Some Amazon and eBay retailers are also selling the phone with a year of service for at or even less than a year card alone, which makes this essentially a free upgrade for existing Tracfone users. That alone makes this worth a hard look. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:41:57	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

65290268	This phone is fantastic. I switched from an iPhone 4, mainly because I could write apps for it in Silverlight (since I am a .NET developer by day). While I knew it would be limited compared to an iPhone, I was pleasantly surprised by many features that actually surpass the iPhone. The best feature of the phone, by far, is the music app. Having already had a Zune Pass subscription, being able to download entire albums for free (apart from my monthly subscription, that is) even over-the-air is a great feature. One thing that the iPhone does not support is the Bluetooth AVRCP profile, so after pairing the phone with my car stereo, i can turn on the car, press Play on the dash, and it starts playing music from the phone, entirely wireless, without me even taking it out of my pocket. Then, if I don't like a song, I can hit next on the dash and skip it. The iPhone doesn't support AVRCP, so you have to control it on the phone itself, and the quality of the iPhone audio over bluetooth is no where near the quality of this phone!The browser is okay, but should be getting much better with the update later this year. Many sites optimized for mobile will recognize the mobile version of IE so you can use most iPhone-optimized sites.The only complaint I have about this phone, really the ONLY one, is that the camera is awful compared to the iPhone 4, even compared to the iPhone 3GS. I was really disappointed in the camera, having been spoiled by the iPhone. However, compared to older smartphones and other Android devices, the camera is pretty good, and has an LED flash which helps. Shots outdoors in full sunlight look pretty good, but indoor shots are near worthless. Maybe a software update will help this in the future *fingers crossed*. However, it still doesn't make me wish I had the iPhone back -- the Zune app alone makes this phone killer! 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:44:33	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Camera		false

27960778	4 stars mostly because of the price.  I couldn't find a new unlocked phone that compared in price so it seems BLU doesn't have a whole lot of competition.  I've only had it one day, but so far it's fine.  I'm using it to temporarily replace my Nexus which I dropped.  Best thing with this phone.  If I drop it, I don't give a crap! It's 25 bucks.So, it's like a plastic toy phone.  The screen and texting is like going back to the stone ages of cell phones as expected.  It has a crappy radio, mp3 player, calendar, torch, non-existent social networking, video player, tiny camera with 10k of space to store pictures (unless you can afford one of dem sd cards).  Maybe it would make a good Obama phone.  Get rid of the useless features and sell it for $5 cheaper for people like me who just want a disposable phone?It does have ringer profiles.

It is a strong and durable phone. It may feel a bit heavy in the beginning, however, the weight is not noticeable after a day or two, in fact, I feel must comfortable carrying it in my hand (although it fits rather nicely in my jeans, my sport coat, and my pajama pants while I lounge at home)the Lumia was designed to be a tool one can carry and really on for work, recreation, or whatsoever your bag may be.The App, the Apps, why is everyone so big on this app craze? The phone is loaded with everything I needed. In fact, I went surfing for apps to add just to use up some of the memory on the mobile, but, it seems that everything that I needed is on my Lumia already, I downloaded all of the Nokia offerings, USA today, CNN, Bloomberg, Calvin and Hobbs, Chase Banking, Starbuck easy pay (cool) and a few others, but, there was really nothing else I needed...the phone is a complete package.  I will never use an android again, and the IPhone 5 is now with my godfathers wife (and she now wants a Lumia)...it doesn't get better than this. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:47:44	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65951134	I had this phone for 2 weeks and thought it was great. I enjoyed the camera, but the touch screen was very sensitive. I bought the protective case and my phone had dropped to the floor, about a 2 feet drop, and instantly the touch screen stopped working. There isn't a scratch or ding on the phone...it wasn't a hard fall at all. I have dropped other cell phones numerous times even where the battery comes flying out, and those falls all still worked. I called Samsung and of course there is nothing they can do for me except charge me an arm and a leg to fix it. So now I have a 2 week old phone that doesn't work. Don't get this phone if you think there is a chance you might drop it!! 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:50:48	Complaint	Unable to Use	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

66014320	I won't go into deals about the phone because I think others have done really good reviews (read reviews from the gray phone as well) but I will go into details about my experience.Here are few things I want to focus on:1- INTEGRATION: what I mean here is the integration between apps and the main functionality of the phone. I use the calling feature a lot ( expected ) but also I don't want to launch each individual social app to find someone I want to SMS/Chat/Call. Basically it has a universal contacts so if you use Tango/Viper/WhatsApp/Skype/Google Voice you will find it so easy to find the person and do whatever you want. I make lots of international calls so I use 3rd party app to make phone calls (along with GVoice). I've used this 3rd party with the iPhone but it was buggy and it always crashes plus I have to launch it each time and find a person to call. With Android, I can just configure the app to be used when I call internationally. The same goes for Google Voice.2- NOTIFICATION: I use social apps like WhatsApp alot but with the iPhone it used to drain battery and not work properly with the iOS notification. I've to open it all the time to make sure someone is talking to me. The notification for this phone (probably Android thing) is just amazing. With the power and memory of this phone, all apps just push their notification smoothly. Slide down with your finger from top to bottom and you see all your notifications. It could get annoying but you can always turn it off or silent your phone.3- S-PEN: As others have mentioned, this is probably the best part of the phone. I can't imagine not using it and believe me you will just love it. It has so much features and is very precise when writing. I use it almost all the time.4- BATTERY: I charge the phone at night only. I use it from the time I wake up till I charge it again at midnight. I won't exaggerate if I say that I use it heavily from sending emails, to lots of FB to youtube to all social apps (Skype/SMS/WhatsApp/Viper/Tango) to email and lots of browsing and it will survive till the end of the day. The screen is almost on 75% of the time. I have to say that while it is not a PC but I've not used my PC that much since I got this phone.5- SPEED: with all the points above, switching between all the apps I work with is just blazing fast. No lag whatsoever. It is very fast and loads quickly.6- MULTI-TASKING: You can literally use two apps at the same time (not all apps though). Just drag an app from the side menu to the screen and it will split both ups (top and bottom)7- AUTO-COMPLETE/SENTENCE COMPLETION: it is so amazing smart I literally type few letters and it gives me so many options to finish. It also predicts the next word based on your selection and you type a 15 words SMS in 5 seconds. As an FYI, it does this for more than ONE language I use (English/Arabic). With the iPhone, it was really a piss off. Each time it overwrites what I type and I keep hitting the erase/back key on the keyboard.8- CONTINUOUS WRITING: For both languages I use - again - I just move the S-PEN (or my finger) on the keyboard and it will accurately finish words for me. I am honestly surprised at its accuracy. About 90% of the time it is always correct. English accuracy is higher than when I type in Arabic.9- SIMPLE MOBILE/T-MOBILE: I live in Northern VA and there are so many new towers with the 1900 band. However only when I am next to them I get 3G/HSPA+ but the speed - while driving; I know :) - is about 5.5Mbps down and 2.5Mbps uploads. 99.9% of the time I am on EDGE. I might move to Simple Talk but to be honest I do a lot of SMS internationally. If Simple Talk will cut off my line when sending couple of International SMSs then that would be crazy. The majority of my time is at work or at my home. At work I use the PC so I don't care about 3G/4G while at home I use my Wifi. At the end of the day, you need to really evaluate your needs. EDGE is more than enough for me for email/light social apps.10- TABLET ALTERNATIVE: I would only use a table for reading books since I've 100's of technical PDF books. I've read few large Apress PDF technical books and I can see myself reading from this phone straight. I don't think it will be ideal but it was just so hard on the iPhone since I was constantly zooming in and out.11- FINGERPRINTS: I am not sure if I read some reviews that said it does not get fingerprints easily but this is not true. It is like a magnet and don't listen to their reviews.Finally, I was lucky to get my two phones from Amazon LLC and not a third party seller. I just don't trust these guys for the amount I paid for my phones and I was lucky to get the last two white ones. I've really enjoyed the phone every time I use it and it is worth every penny. I don't think I need to jump to any phone for few years to come (unless I break this, hopefully not).Finally thanks to all the previous 5-star reviewers here at Amazon. They've done really a good job giving this phone with it deserves. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:53:26	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65056371	I waited from November last year when I first saw the reviews on the Note until a few days ago to finally order it through Amazon. After making the decision to buy, I had to decide which vendor to order from (TRD Trading GmbH). I made the right choices all the way. When I received the box, inside was another box and inside that box was the Note and a power adapter. The Note was sealed in its own box and my confidence went through the roof. After working through the app's I plugged it in to charge it. After about 3 hours of charging the note has an audio indicator when the charge reaches 100%. I turned it on and it went into the notification screen and automatically began an update from 3.2.5 to 3.2.6. So far so gooooood.Everything that the device has installed is as close to perfect as you can get. Yes, there are newer apps and I later downloaded a few of those but if you leave the functions as they are, there are no complaints. My favorites are, MP3 player with 5.1 surround sound with a headset plugged in. The note and stylus function are superb with just about every feature you can imagine.The FM radio is great. The GPS is spot on and the mapping graphics are superb due to the screen resolution. The screen has no pixels that I can see and the depth and color are outstanding. The 8 mega-pixel camera is just as good as the iphone 4s. This device stands above all the other devices I have owned. Ipad 1, Ipad 2, Asus Transformer, Asus Transformer prime, HTC Flyer, Samsung Galaxy 7.0. I have been looking for the ultimate device with the smallest footprint. I found it in the Note. This device is so snappy when opening any apps or widgets. Online via WiFi with just 1 signal bar was faster than anything I have experienced before. The Bluetooth is a rocket when paired to my i mac 24.When in public, people can not keep their eyes or hands off it. GREAT JOB SAMSUNG. I sold my new iphone 4s to a friend for $175.00 because her phone was stolen and it was difficult for her to pay more than she did. I don't miss the iphone at all. In fact, the Note is 20 times the experience the iphone offers. When my friend first saw the Note, she felt cheated LOL. She will have to marry me to get my Note.I ordered the SGP ultra thin case which fits like a glove but is still a little slippery so I just ordered the BoxWave DuoSuit TPU case and the little pigtail adapter to download files.Micro USB Host Mode OTG Cable Flash Drive SD T-Flash Card Adapter FOR Samsung GT-i9100 i9100 Galaxy S II 2 GT-N7000 Galaxy NoteAt the ATT; store, they transferred my micro SIM to the standard SIM and I went online to Youtube to configure the phone settings, everything worked. The staff at ATT; had not seen the Note yet and were amazed. I ordered the white model because it looks bigger. Go to Maker4U dot com to see some very cool accessories.I highly recommend this device through Amazon. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:55:42	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
67890837	As someone who is very into Andriod, I decided to go out on a limb and try out the Windows OS. I have had this phone for about a year now. I am not going to lie, I am pretty disappointed by the phone and the operating system. but it works alright for what it is.PHONE:I have issues once or twice a week where the phone will shut off unexpectedly. After consistently happening for this long, I was hoping a software update would help fix the issue but it clearly has not. This leads me to believe it is a hardware issue, but the people at Verizon keep telling me it's a software issue and the next update would fix it.As far as durability, this phone is an absolute tank. I have yet to put a case on my phone (living dangerously) and I have dropped it a handful of times. There are some scratches on the corners of the plastic housing, but the screen is in perfect condition.The response time has it's ups and downs. Some times it will be lightning fast, some times it will lag a few seconds. I am always careful to kill all my tasks too.WINDOWS 8 OS:This OS looks sweet. I love the minimalistic layout and the customizability it has. In terms of function, it's kind of limited. Nokia has put out a bunch of really cool apps, like city lens and panorama. The GPS system it comes with is absolutely amazing. It beats all of my friends iPhones and Androids to crap. I would argue it rivals a legitimate GPS system for your car. But in actuality I don't use all of the stock apps to much.The live tile idea is awesome, but it rarely works how it should. They don't load properly until you open the apps, then they will update, which kind of defeats their purpose. The ideas they have going into the OS is great, but they need some optimization.App development is leagues behind Apple and Android. If you're someone who likes a lot of apps, you're going to have to rely on a bunch of 3rd party software. If you're okay with that than go ahead, but I prefer to go with the big developers. It seems like no one really makes quality apps for it. Give it a couple years, i bet it will be fine, but until then I am not going to rave about app availability.OVERALL:I will not be getting another windows phone. I would not really recommend it to anyone else unless you're more business oriented. As a college student I find Android and Apple will better suit my desires. It's not well enough developed for me to really get into it. It was well worth the try, but it's not for me. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:55:42	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

65773375	The phone has worked well so far here in Venezuela, but it came without the manual pocket without the headphones. I purchased the Latin American version to prevent it does not come in Spanish, however in those days a coworker bought the international version for less dollars and full came. The provider only gave me back $ 20 for the manual, claiming that the headphones do not come with the phone. It is the first time that I bought a phone I sold without the headphones. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:55:42	Complaint	Other	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	price	false
64653386	I upgraded to the Nexus 5 from a Nexus S 4G. An issue I had with my previous phone was how underpowered it was. After two years' worth of Android system updates, my old phone was pretty slow. A major problem with the Nexus S was the partitioning of the storage space into 2GB and 14GB divisions, which compounded the speed problem with memory issues as well. The Nexus 5 does not have either of these problems because of the new multi-core processor inside, and the entire 16GB of storage space is a single partition and accessible for both installation of apps and storage of photos, etc.The Nexus 5 is very slim and sleek, but many of the cases available for it square off the slightly rounded edges of the phone in addition to adding thickness to the phone, making it a little chunky. This may be a reasonable trade-off if a case prevents your screen of becoming damaged when your phone is dropped.The screen on the Nexus 5 is large and bright. You may want to turn the brightness setting down to conserve battery life, as the screen is responsible for as much as a third of my total battery consumption over the course of the day. With respect to the physical size of the phone, using it one-handed could be difficult if you have small hands. I wear medium/large size gloves, and have no problem with this. The large screen certainly helps with typing using the on-screen keyboard. Far fewer missed keys compared to my older phone.I bought this phone on/around Cyber Monday, so it was on sale for $35 on Amazon for a device upgrade with Sprint. The price may have changed since then. If you're looking to buy the phone off-contract, the Google Play store may be a better deal.When upgrading my phone, I was also considering the HTC One and the Moto X, which are both also great phones. I decided to go with the Nexus 5 because I prefer to run an Android phone without additional manufacturer-specific skins on top. These skins often add features or visual effects I don't use but will still consume system resources. Additionally, the Nexus 5 has a high repairability score from iFixit, which is also important to me. If a part of the phone breaks, I'd rather replace the broken part than buy a whole new phone. The Moto X also has a high repairability score, but the HTC One is not really repairable at all. Another advantage of the Nexus devices are the speed with which they receive Android system updates. You can read more about that elsewhere. Specific to the Nexus 5, the camera software was not particularly good upon launch of the phone in November. By the time I purchased and activated my phone in December, a new system update had been issued, and the camera software was upgraded in that release. The photos taken with the Nexus 5 rival those taken with my friend's iPhone 5, if that is a concern for you. I don't have a comparison to the iPhone 5S. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 03:55:42	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Camera		false

64181633	Pros: Intuitive, easy-to-use interface. Many tasks can be completed in less time than on Apple and Android devices. Boots fast, decent battery life (always lasts through the day). Stable and reliable. Exclusive Nokia apps like #34;Music#34; and #34;Drive#34; give the device an edge over other manufacturer's windows phones.As for design, the sleek, uni-body device really stands out. The dedicated camera button can wake the phone, unlock it, and have the user snapping photos immediately.Integration with Skydrive works very well.Cons: Windows app store is kind of limited, but only if you're looking for a few specific apps. There are third-party workarounds for most popular apps. Not compatible with Windows Phone 8 apps unless the developer ports it over.Camera quality is not as great as it should be. Some photos have a yellowish tint to them. This can be fixed with an auto-fix feature that's built-in to the device, but it's an extra step that seems unnecessary. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:02:27	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Defect	Applications	Software		false

22223274	Maybe I'm not as tech savvy as I thought I was but I cannot for the life of me get the phone to work how I want.*First off I keep my phone on vibrate. This phone doesn't even bother to light up or VIBRATE when I get a text message. Calls? Yes. Text? No. I've missed many messages just because my phone doesn't alert me.*Phone overheats way too easily and has poor battery life. Even with a battery saver my phone will only last a few hours if I'm barely using it. When I'm away from a charger for an extended period of time I have to be very resourceful with my phone usage so that I might actually have battery life in case of an emergency.*Keyboard application constantly freezes and quits. Makes texting/typing slow and a pain. Sometimes requiring me to restart my phone so that it'll work properly.*Video's are too large to send to anything. I've recorded a few videos to share. However they are too large that I cannot email or text them to anyone.*comes with a few useless apps/games that you cannot delete which imo is a waste of valuable space.The brightness, home screen layout is alright.

65996892	The phone per se is OK. It has a very good camera and is pretty fast. A couple of times. I have had to reset the phone because the camera wouldn't work. One drawback is that the phone does not have a back button so sometimes the swiping back can be troublesome. Another drawback - for me a major drawback - is the lack of apps; I am getting to the point of frustration because about 2 out of 3 apps I want to install does not exist for the Z10; even some apps that I did have installed on my previous Blackberry aren't available for this one. So, if you just want a good phone with a good camera, this one is as good as any; but if you want to use the most popular apps on your phone, steer clear of the Z10! 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:07:50	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Camera		false

64591885	Owned this phone for 7 months. Windows phone is just a #34;dumbed down#34; version of a smart phone. When I first got it, it would lock-up and you could not turn it off because it was unresponsive. Very poor choices for settings-if there is some behavior you don't like, forget about being able to change it. Very annoying if you place it in your pocket when its on because VR activates and goes on and off with little nagging noises. Vibrator alert  is hardly discernible. Battery life EXTREMELY POOR, Plan on 6 hours tops. It got so bad that I had to order extra chargers to keep at work and in the shop to keep it charged up. Gives new meaning to the Brand #34;Hot Pocket#34;. Hot when charging, hot in use, hot when idling.  You need to get some kind of protection for it too. The Gorilla Glass goes right to the edge with a very thin plastic bezel around it. One corner drop and your glass is toast. Repair cost $199. The glass alone can not be replaced. They have to replace the Glass, digitizer and LCD because they are all bonded together. Virtual keyboard is very difficult to type on, esp in the vertical mode. You can't change the keyboard type.  Verizon has an application with it called Backup Assistant Plus... It winds up creating TWO contact databases instead of one. So when you go into contacts it asks which one you want to use... Very frustrating.Microsoft can make laptop and desktop computer OS's but they have a long way to go with the Windows Phone.Don't be part of their Experiment unless that kind of thing appeals to you! 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:07:50	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

66533330	I was really disappointed. I really thought Apple would have had more updated options. They have added extra steps and made it more difficult to delete messages and emails. Even though I had deleted all my emails on my home computer, when I got my new phone and synced it, it downloaded thousands of emails that had been deleted. Apple still has no way to delete mass emails even though we have all requested it or least help with this issue they have created for us. Voice search still needs tweaked. You have to practically yell for it to understand you.  The calendar doesn't have flexible options for scheduling. It is very basic.

65707402	I've been eyeing this phone for awhile now and I must admit it didn't look as big until I actually held it in my hand.  WOW!  I don't think I could go back to a small screen again.  Everything was fine with the phone however my GUARANTEED shipping day which was suppose to be the next day didn't happen.  I ordered the phone on a thursday.  I was suppose to receive it by friday.  I didn't have the phone in my hand until Monday.  UPS tracking said it was in my home town and it said it was on the truck for delivery by friday and of course I was excited but it didn't actually arrive at my house until after the weekend.  that was LAME.  Amazon's tracking service was not updating my package status so I went to the official UPS website and imputed my tracking info and it stated that it would be delivered monday while Amazon's tracking said it on the truck out for delivery the whole weekend.  Other then the shipping the phone was great but I wouldn't have paid for next day shipping if I wasn't going to get it the next day. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:09:41	Other	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	delivery problems	false
65786790	I really like this phone.  I bought it because I had work in South Africa for 3 months and needed something that I could put a local sim card in.  I like this phone so much that I think I will keep it and use it when I get back to the States.-Calls are both reliable and clear which I think is the most important thing(it is a phone first after all)-The keyboard takes some getting used to but I think I now prefer it to either a qwerty(takes up too much space w/ too small of buttons for fingers like mine), a touch screen(same finger problem) or a regular keypad.  I don't have excessively large hands but I def do have man hands so I find many things are not built with me in mind.  If this is not your case then you can disregard this part but I find that many of the men I work with and my friends tend to have similar issues.-I didn't really want a flip phone either but now that I have one I am becoming a fan(no pocket dialing or key locking etc.)-Battery life is good.  I turned on the music player and left it on speaker to see how long it would take to drain the thing and after 4 hrs and less than half the battery gone gave up.-Camera isn't that great but is more than adequate for a phone like this.-I like that I can turn off data services and keep wi-fi on so that I don't get clipped in the US for a blackberry plan and can still use data from wi-fi(obviously not as great if you don't have regular wi-fi spots but if data is that important to you then you can always purchase the plan)-The screen isn't that big(it is more than adequate though)  It is bright and crisp-Interface is good and I like having a smaller phone with the blackberry ball-Music production quality is really good and doesn't drain the battery(see above) plus the ability to expand the memory is nice.-Basic memory included is really not adequate if you are going to actually use this as a blackberry or music phone but I picked up a microSD 4gb for less than $10 and am so far happy so plan on buying a card-Phone seems pretty durable but I haven't had it that long so I will update this as I go-I have read some reviews about the phone being to slow or not working etc. I think this is prob a hardware issue that would be covered as long as you buy one with a warranty.  I think it is also the effect of the 1 in 1000 customers who get a bad phone to be unhappy enough to write a review while 999 ppl who are content won't.-This is NOT a smartphone but it does do what you need it too.  Personally I don't want a phone that is too big just so I can do inadequate work on it.  I can do the basics of what I need to while on the go and if I need to do something serious I will sit down and pull out my laptop.  That is my preference though.All in all a great phone for a reasonable price.  I would highly recommend it to anyone either traveling or just looking for an unlocked phone in the U.S. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:09:41	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

You'll have to call tracfone (from another phone) to reset the phone at which you'll have to enter a lockscreen code. This code is NOT the factory set code. It will be the last four digits of your number. The phone works great, but don't make the same mistake as I did. Customer service was very helpful to remedy the problem, but at the cost of losing my number that I've had for nearly a decade. It was a headache, but I'm still happy with the phone, with the service, with tracfone as a company. It's the only problem I've ever had with the company. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:12:48	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false
66801714	I love the phone.  It has worked superbly for me.  I came from a much simpler phone, so getting used to all of the options was a bit challenging but very fun at the same time.  There are two things I'd like to talk about with this phone:  Size, and Samsung's Customer Service.Size:I can never go back to a smaller screen.  I really don't care that sometimes it is tough to reach some of the letters when texting or that I almost drop it sometimes when I don't have a good grip on it.  I love having so much screen real estate!  I love it and I will never go back.  In general though, I don't have much trouble texting on it or using it one handed even without enabling the special one handed use feature.  I'm 6'2#34; so I'm somewhat taller than average, so it may be that I'm just large enough for the size to be a good fit.Samsung's Customer Service:Terrible.  I don't think they really get how it's supposed to be done.  I don't think they really understand how to please customers the right way.  That's probably why they have so many useless features all piled on the phone.  Get rid of some of them and make others just plain work better!  Anyway, it started with my phone arriving.  I opened the box and got right into everything, then noticed that there wasn't an included headset.  I just thought, #34;Wow, are they really that cheap that they can't even include a headset(that probably costs them $1 to make) with their most expensive phone?#34;  So I contacted customer service to see if there was any way I could get one.  I had sold my pair of Beats headphones since I don't listen to music as much anymore and had been thinking I'd use the stock headset that I thought would come with it.  I basically got a flat #34;no.#34;  My next aggravation came when I saw a news article that said #34;Free $50 Google Play credit for Note 3 Customers.#34;  I quickly made my way to the link provided, only to be met with a screen that said #34;Due to the high demand, we have run out of our supply of credits.  Thank you for your interest!#34;  The promotion was supposed to run for 2 months and instead lasted less than 2 weeks.  Really Samsung?  I contacted customer service again to see if there was any way a disgruntled customer could get in on those free credits.  Again, a flat #34;no.#34;  These are somewhat little things, but it's the little things that make good customer service, and I feel like Samsung fails miserably in that department. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:12:48	Complaint	Other	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

90362245	Bought this phone directly from ATT last week as they were offering the wireless charging plate along with it.  Compared to my husband's SIII this device is definitely a bit more hefty (I just had to find something to complain about). But in all seriousness I love this phone. The call quality is great and the camera is just Amazing. Now it did take a bit to get used to the tiles and overall navigation but now that I have used it for a few days, I think it provides more of a richer user experience than Android. The Nokia Maps that can be used offline for navigation purposes are a plus. As a mom I also really like the kid zone feature as it helps control what my kids can access when I allow them to play games on the phone. Did I mention I am able to charge my phone wirelessly. Even though the build quality is great; I would highly recommend getting a case and a screen protector especially if you have kids that love to play with your devices and accidentally drop em. Wish I had purchased them while at the store but I did not get them as I thought the accessories offered were plainly overpriced and there was not much to choose from. Anyways have ordered a screen protector through Amazon (was def less expensive than  the ones being offered at the store, will most probably receive it sometime tomorrow...will share if it is worth the buy). Now with regards to a case, am still looking for one as I am yet to find one that I really like (open to suggestions) 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:14:31	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66553705	I needed a replacement phone immediately.  Because I *completely* resent the $18 'upgrade' fee T-Mobile charges on top of the cost of a new phone, I've decided to buy unlocked or non contracted phones from now on.  I didn't know what kind of 'good' phone I wanted, so I bought this as a stand in... I just slid my regular sim card in when it arrived and I was good to go (i.e. I did not use any sort of pay as you go, pre-paid service with it).The good:It works.  It makes calls. Calls are clear. It was a cheap filler phone and I'll hang on to it for that purpose again.  There's a music player which works well.There are two fun games included with it--sodoku and tetris--which work well and don't seem to be 'demos'.The not great but dealable:No bluetooth, no email client.  It's a cheap phone, so not having those things wasn't unexpected but I realized how much I'd grown to like both of those things.The memory expansion card is underneath the battery--not very convenient.The battery itself is a REALLY tight fit...I've never had one which is so hard to remove (which makes dealing with the memory card more of a pain than I'm used to.The not so great stuff that I didn't like about the design which goes beyond the it's 'it's a basic phone' explanation:The headphone jack isn't a 'standard' one...and the included earbuds are utter crap so I've really missed my stereo bluetooth ones.  It's a shame because the music player itself isn't bad.The photo viewer is a disappointment.  Pictures don't fill the screen well and take forever to load.  Waste of time.Perhaps the most significant is that I've had a LOT of phones and this has the tightest, most uncomfortable key configuration.  The buttons seem hard to press and my hand cramps up.  I'm not a texting maniac but I REALLY hate texting on this phone (and I've never thought about it before).I can't figure out how to turn off the annoying little jangley chirpy sound when I plug or unplug it in to charge.  Annoying when that wakes up my husband late or in the morning. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:17:57	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Camera		false

65926584	I bought this to see if it would end up being cheaper than a contract phone, and because I figured I could use it as a music player, etc. As a phone, it is surprisingly useful for the price. And I appreciate being able to get (slow but functional) internet access without a $20/month fee.I am disappointed in the memory card slot... Someone posted in a review that it would take a 32GB memory card, however this is absolutely not true. It is 4 GB max. Not exactly going to hold much of anything. This kills half of it's utility for me.In short, if this were priced higher, it would be a 2 to 3 star phone. But for $55 (phone plus 200 minutes card) using coupons and the included triple minutes deal, you get 5 months of use plus 650 minutes. Definitely an inexpensive way to have a phone around if one doesn't talk a lot. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:20:43	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

This was a perfect fit because she had the same one with T-Mobile and all I had to do was charge it, replace the sim card and that's it. The price was right and in todays market with most plans going to no contract and supplying your own phone, you will see more people buys phones for under $30 bucks rather than pay $600 for something that wont last a year! 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:20:43	Other	Other	Software	Replacement	Hardware	Software	price concerns	false
66554281	This is my second blackberry. My previous phone was a Bold9000 which I had for a while. I love the Bold series and contemplated upgrading to the 9780. But then the 9900 came out and I contemplated that as well. After reading the reviews on it however concerning the battery life, I decided against it. I decided to go for the 9810 instead. The specs are basically the same - 8gb, 5mp camera, touch screen/keyboard etc. So for me, there was really no big difference except the slide. Another  motivation as well was the ability to use BOTH the touchscreen AND the keyboard. I am not a huge fan of full touchscreen phones (and devices in general) and so this fits exactly what I was looking for.I have had it for a little under two months now and I am loving it. The OS7 is obviously quite different from the OS4 that my old Bold was running but it is easy to use and I figured out how to do things very quickly. The camera takes clear pictures and also has the flash option. I do not have freezing issues or anything of that sort.My battery generally lasts about 2 days. I generally use it for bbming, emailing, surfing, listening to music (off and on) and of course making/receiving calls. I cannot speak for different types of usage such as videos, games etc. For me that's good enough. I have a friend with the 9900 and by the end of the day they have to charge their phone and as I pointed out that was a major issue for me in choosing.My only issue (if it really is one) is the keyboard. It took me a while to get accustomed to it. This may be of course because I was used to the bold's keyboard which was much sturdier. Initially, I was afraid that this one would break (I know it sounds silly) but I have gotten over that now. Ok...long and short, am glad I bought this phone and would recommend it. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:20:43	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65452179	This phone is way overhyped.  Its features do not justify its price, this phone's primary purpose is to make a fashion statement not innovate.  I'm glad I changed this phone for the truly supererior moto Mpx220.  Which has expandable memory, mp3 player, megapixel camera, windows 2003, bluetooth, video playback, Quad band and its unlocked,  and I like the design much better and its much cheaper.  The Razr has no expandable memory only 5 megs. It is Quad Band. It has a Thin but flimsy and still bulky design.  Reception is ok but I like the Mpx220 better in that deparment. The only thing worth mentioning is the screen which is gorgeous truly impressive but still does not justify its price. It has bluetooth but so does the cheaper moto V550, and v600. The camera is not even megapixel. It can only playback videos not record them.  This phone's price needs to come down, its way overpriced for the mediocre features it posses. Again do not buy this phone, unless all u want to do is show off the amount of mone that was thrown away on this phone.

54607990	Very, Very disappointed in this product and the company that sells it! This Company, BLU, doesn't provide a customer with actual operating, key functions diagrams for cell phone operations..  In other words, the so called instructions doesn't tell you what keys are what and what they're supposed to do for the operation of the cell phone.  When I contact the company, their Rep. acted surprised that I wanted a instructional; diagram, that there was not diagram pointing out various key functions!? !!?  The company has no plans to provide said diagrams at this point!!?  Someone from Amazon should have a serious talk with these folks at BLU!  As I've returned the cell phone to the company.  I've told my friends and neighbors to not buy from this company as they're kinda of new and don't have it together, yet. You know at one point, I considered going to a local Faith Healer, Madam Good, a seer, of dubious reputation so she could take a crack at helping me figure out the safe, operation of the cell phone! But then I figured she would need a big looking glass to see, discover the real, real, small, super fine print that passed for cell phone instructions! I know of what I speak as I used my own large looking glass to see what could be seen by a piece of old analog equipment? Alas, I couldn't make out any helpful, clear instructions?  Of course the fun thought entered by stuffy head as I openly wondered if by placing said phone on top of semi-fake Faith Healer, Madam Good's, heaving, very large, thankfully firm bosoms to test the phone signals strength! Those fun plans had to be shelved/dashed as I couldn't come up with the $50.00 per visit fee! So here I sit without a cell phone to be with  me at all times as I go about my daily business travelling the byways of the O.C., Anaheim, So. Cali.. I only wanted something that would work when I needed it the most! A small wish to be sure! 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:26:07	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Internal Hardware		false

65422081	ENGLISH (abajo en Espantilde;ol)This mobile phone is more than I expected after reading all the reviews found in the web.Even when there was no warranty and no stamp in the box about warranty, once you turn it up you will find that this device is amazing.This one (I bought it from the OEM Shop) is running Andriod 2.3.4 using the UHKG7 kernel, so its not necessary to be updated.Video calls from Gtalk are not supported in this firmware but the batterylife is quite good. It can last one day (regular use).Writting with SWYPE is a very delightfull experience. The swype writting is just one step ahead of the others, is state of the art.I thought it would be so big to take in my hands, but it isn't, I feel very confortable holding it and also I can take it into my pocket, is very very thin.The videos and pictures are amazing, very clear. It features 1080p for real, I recorded a video and then I used the Micro USB to HDMI MHL adapterto plug it to my HDTV and the picture and video quality was perfect!The screen is perfect, is very clear, it has a very good resolution and everybody around me love the screen of this phone.I haven't tried the GPS and still other features, but with this toy there are many things to play with.I am a very happy SGSII owner, a satisfied customer.I highly reccomend to get this device instead of any BB or iPhone.Meet you in the Hubs...Este teleacute;fono es maacute;s de lo que esperaba despueacute;s de leer todas las revisiones que se encuentran en Internet.Auacute;n cuando no habiacute;a garantiacute;a y ninguacute;n sello de garantiacute;a en la caja, una vez que enciendes el teleacute;fono te das cuenta de que esun aparato increiacute;ble.Este que compreacute; (lo compreacute; con The OEM Shop) vino corriendo Android 2.3.4 usando el Kernel UHKG7, por lo que no se necesita actualizarlo.No estaacute;n habilitadas las videollamadas desde Gtalk en este firmware, pero la duracioacute;n de la bateriacute;a es muy buena. Puede durar todo un diacute;a (daacute;ndole un uso regular).Escribir con SWYPE es una experiencia uacute;nica. La escritura swype estaacute; un paso maacute;s adelante de los demaacute;s, es tecnologiacute;a de punta.Penseacute; que el teleacute;fono seriacute;a muy grande para llevarlo en las manos, pero no lo es, me siento muy coacute;modo sostenieacute;ndolo y ademaacute;s puedo llevarlo en mi bolsillo (del pantaloacute;n), es muy muy delgado.Los videos y las fotos son excelentes, muy claras. Graba 1080p de verdad, grabeacute; un video y utiliceacute; el adaptador Micro USB a HDMI MHL para conectarlo a mi TV HD y la calidad de las fotos y videos es impresionante.La pantalla es perfecta, muy niacute;tida, tiene una muy buena resolucioacute;n y a todo el mundo alrededor de miacute; le encanta la pantalla de este teleacute;fono.No he probado ni el GPS ni otras funciones, pero con este juguete hay muchas cosas con las que se puede jugar.Soy un feliz duentilde;o de un SGSII, un cliente satisfecho.Recomiendo altamente comprar este equipo en lugar de un BB o un iPhone.Nos vemos en las redes... 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:28:08	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64821969	What more can I do with it (compared to iPhone or Android):1. Navigate anytime with a fantastic GPS module and free life time navigation (including turn by turn voice navigation with street names, lane guidance, speed limit warning, traffic etc.!!). Go buy crap GPS software for iPhone for a huge price (last time checked was more than 50$) and even then that won't even come close to Nokia navigation. Don't forget Nokia owns Navteq (the worlds largest map producer)2. Transmit FM and play it on your car music system (iPhone doesn't even have a FM receiver)3. The best camera (those of u who read the misleading review of endgadget, if u r really reading my review, then u r serious and go ahead to search on google to find zillions of unbiased camera review, comparing N8 even against DSLR)4. Pentaband network support, which would let you use the phone with both ATT; and T-Mobile 3g network!!5. Dolby surround sound output6. USB on the go (which means you could connect your USB device with the phone!)7. Bluetooth 3.08. The only OS that has a very complete bluetooth stack implementation (perhaps too technical for some of the readers) that allows u to even control ur powerpoint presentation with ur cellphone (using salling clicker). The poor iPhone guys, no ur phone doesn't have that functionality (crippled at OS level)9. The OS that gives superb battery life (anyone using Symbian would testify for this)10. The freedom that comes with an open OS (OK, Android is also open)11. The most configurable and complete enterprise wireless stack (trust me, I never ever had any problem to configure my Nokia phones for the most convoluted enterprise wireless network!)12. A built in completely integrated VOIP support. You won't even notice that u r using VOIP. And trust me, if u know how to use VOIP effectively, u could save a huge amount on your phone bill13. The ability to work as Bluetooth HSPA modem (or even create Wifi hotspot with third party software)14. The TRUE TRUE TRUE multi tasking. Yes that's three TRUEs. No one else (including the upcoming Windows Phone 7) supports true multi-tasking. If u ever use Symbian multitasking, u would hate to use others' sham multitasking15. Many many ... can't list. Feeling tired :( Users are welcome to comment and add additional pros and cons. I am sure there will be Nokia fanboys and iPhone and Android fanboys.What can't I do (or can't do so well):1. The UI (yes iPhone and Android have better intuitive UI)2. I can't fart with my mobile (but I do have all the apps that I would ever need: e.g. call screening software, office software, pdf reader, flash support, email solution, the entire Oxford, cambridge or a host of other dictionaries etc.)3. Zillions of games that you may avail on iPhone, u may not have on Nokia yet (believe me it's changing fast). BTW, N8 has a faster GPU than iPhone4!Now some misleading media propaganda:1. N8 has only 680 MHz processor: Believe me Symbian is by born very efficient. If u ever own a Mac and try to run a Windows 7 in a virtual machine then u know how slow it is. Processor doesn't define speed. I started with a 233MHz pentium processor with 32MB RAM which ran Windows 98 extremely fast with all Office applications, a bunch of productivity apps and a host of games. To give a recent example look at Windows Vista, which runs very slow on the same computer compared to Windows 7 or Mac OS X!2. N8 has only 256MB RAM: Again u don't need that much RAM. The Symbian^3 has Writable data paging which works like virtual memory. And don't forget, Symbian is built from ground up to be battery, memory and processor efficient. No other OS (including Android) claims that feat.So, in conclusion, if u r looking for a very modern looking user interface, go for iPhone (or Android). But if u r like me who shops for functionality (and who dreams to carry only one gadget (no GPS, no camera, no Apple remote etc.)) then surely u should give N8 a serious thought. And don't let naysayers fool u with usability issues. Believe me, with just couple of days of use, every unintuitive UI would become intuitive (I am a Symbian veteran and it feels very intuitive to me). 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:30:11	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64244488	Hi,I brought 'Google Nexus One Unlocked Phone with Android--U.S. Warranty (Brown)' from this seller. Right after few days of buying my phone started hanging when I used to talk. It continued for some days. I did the factory reset and it got fine but again started.  Then the headphone stopped working. I tried to manage even without headphone. Then slowly a new problem started - The phone started giving trouble while charging. It continued for few days and then it does not charge at all. I tried all different chargers. But it is not charging. I spent almost $300 for the phone and it did not even last for 5-6 months. I am not rough user of phone. My uses are hardly 20-30 minutes each day. But then also it did not last. I am disappointed.I don't want to give bad feedback and spoil somebody's name but at the same time I do not want people to spend money on bad products. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:32:31	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Recall	Features	Software		false

66519713	Bah! Worthless! That's not a testament to the RAZR, just a statement about this particular one! I ordered this phone as a replacement for my damaged RAZR and it was sorely lacking in every department. My original RAZR was awesome. I dropped it (into a puddle, shorting out the keypad) and I decided that since it had served me so well, I would replace it with the upgraded V3 model.For one, it is a European phone. For most things, this shouldn't matter but there are a few terribly niggling details that can't be overlooked. Spelling is all British. Personalise is spelled with a z instead of an s in America. It's a minor detail, but it adds up since every bit of spelling and terminology difers from a normal US phone. You won't know exactly what you're doing if you've used US phones and get this phone. Things are generally in the same spot and named similarly, but it's different enough to be frustrating. Additional example: Dates use the European format of DD-MM-YYYY, instead of MM-DD-YYYY.Texting with this phone is a nightmare. The autocomplete draws from what looks to be French, Italian, Spanish and maybe German as well. I didn't want to delve much more deeply into the phone as I was already irritated beyond measure. My family communicates with texts fairly often and to have the ability to type out a quick text message with the help of autocomplete effectively disabled is simply not acceptable on any level. It turns a 20 second message into a 5 minute message, punching in every single letter.In addition to all that, I plugged the phone in via the European charger + adaptor (with my mind reeling that it's not simply a US charger in the first place) only to find that the battery wouldn't charge. I tried my charger from the old RAZR and got the same problem. Spending this kind of money to talk for maybe 2 hours before needing to get an entirely new battery? No thank you.Lastly, the few calls I tested it on gave terrible reception. I'd blame the destination caller if it weren't to a land line and I'd even blame Cingular/ATT; if the phone hadn't been reporting perfect service.Now, from other reviews, it sounds like many people get good phones via this order system. I will state this: If you got lucky and pulled a working American RAZR from this draw, congratulations. I say: Once bitten, twice shy. No more buying phones this way for me, not until there's considerable more documentation on-line about what's really going to be shipped.I'll be going to Cingular tomorrow to buy a brand new one after going to the post office to return this piece of junk. The reported price on Amazon is actually well over double what the Cingular/ATT website lists the price as, including not signing a contract. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:34:16	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	Replacement	Applications	Internal Hardware		false

28448285	This is a very impressive phone - I got it to replace my old BlackBerry and it is clearly a huge upgrade. The interface is easy to understand, very responsive and colorful. It easily manages my 500+ contacts, the Audible app works great, Nokia Music, Maps and smart photo apps are also excellent. I would really like to give this phone full marks. We have a couple of iPads at home, and I have to say I much prefer the Windows Phone interface.There are, however, a few kinks - some of which are major. The battery lasts through most days, but not always - with the extra free wireless charger from ATT; that is something easy to live with. The Smart Photo app sometimes hangs (although, impressively, the phone has never stalled like my BlackBerry used to - the home button always works). These I could live with.The major showstopper for me (and it is a big one) is that my work email and calendar are based on gmail and there is at least one major problem with how Windows Phone and Gmail interact. The problem is that when replying to emails with long subject lines, Windows Phone often messes up the header - basically rendering the email almost unreadable for the recipient. I want to think this is a small and easy to fix problem, but I was surprised to see it discussed on the Internet as far back as May and with Windows Phone 7. (The problem, in case any Microsoft employees read this, is that Windows Phone is adding extra line breaks in the long subject line - breaking the header and making the encoding and multipart boundaries part of the message body; which ends up rendering as plain text when HTML or some more expressive encoding needed). So I am not very confident a fix is coming.So I am currently torn on whether to keep my phone (and manually edit long subject lines when replying to email) or trade it in for Droid or iPhone (the Galaxy S3 is not advertised as a world phone in the US and probably wouldn't work for me). 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:42:12	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

For the firat time I see a product that had not just tech put in it, but it was carefully crafted and also very well designed. It is not perfect yet! as technology has it limitations still.The Nokia Apps gives some edge to it, and i am in love with it... Can't stop exploring... Nokia has given WP a bit of more salt.If you are not yet a WP person, just try this beauty and you will see... 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:44:33	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

68396884	For months I waited patiently with my Thunderbolt to purchase the Note II. I was online to pre order the Note II and saw this mysterious phone. I thought it was another Moto Razr at first as it wore the Droid moniker. I was wrong.This phone is stunning in every way. This is the benchmark. I am on my third Android phone after being a sulking Blackberry owner. I am very tech savvy and specs matter to me. This phone has all the top specs. This is a flagship device.From all the other reviews you can gather that the screen is simply amazing, its blazing fast, slim, sleek, and rolls out with jellybean. I cant say enough good about this device.Only con I can come up with is the stupid flap over the micro USB. Its annoying, its easily yanked off without losing any of the phones good lines. I have heard the complaints about the battery not being replaceable, and the lack of memory card slot. This is negligible at best. For a few its important, for the masses its a small price to pay to carry THE phone.Buy it. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:46:09	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Ports		false

65634570	Nokia reserves its 7 series for fashion phones: phones where style is the most important feature and which are deliberately not to everyone's taste. Sometimes usability is compromised, and the phones are not usually at the cutting edge, feature-wise. They tend to be love-it or hate-it phones. The 7500 Prism is not as extreme as some of the previous 7 series models, but it is very definitely a fashion phone - no other phone looks like the Prism. Nokia have used conventional materials to make the Prism, and the overall shape is a classic, but the style is in the detail. Bevelled surfaces and geometric patterns are what the Prism is all about. The patterns are continued into the user interface design, making for a polished, integrated feel. The Prism is black in colour, but comes with a choice of replaceable accent colours (blue, green and pink) that decorate the edging of the phone.Although heavily stylised, the Prism is a perfectly usable phone, with keys that are not so different from a conventional keypad. However they are quite small and slippery, and the navigation joystick isn't as easy to use as a navigational pad. On the positive side, the plastic construction does make for a very lightweight phone (just 83g).Feature-wise the Prism isn't an outstanding phone. The LCD display is average, the camera below average, and the video camera well below par. On the other hand, the music player is excellent, being very similar to the one on the 5300 XpressMusic, with support for all the main formats, compatibility with Bluetooth headsets, an equaliser and surround sound / stereo widening. There are nice themes in the player and sound output from the loudspeaker is excellent. The phone's memory is limited to 30 Mbytes, but a memory card can be added to increase the available memory to 2 Gbytes. In addition there's a fully-featured FM radio, with Visual Radio support. This enables you to find out information from the station you're listening to, such as what track is playing, and also provides interactive features such as surveys and voting for your favourite songs.Another interesting twist is the internet support. The Opera Mini web browser is supplied, although with no 3G support, the browsing experience isn't the fastest. A novel feature is the Nokia Sensor which is a mobile social networking tool that lets you connect with other Nokia Sensor users. There's a good choice of pre-installed games too.Connectivity is good, with USB mass storage and Bluetooth compatibility. Battery life is not so good though.To wrap up then, we'll say that we like the 7500 Prism, although it's by no means the best phone practically (the Nokia 6300 is a far superior phone). However, if the design is important to you, then the Prism has few peers. Other fashion phones that you might consider are the 7373, which has a very similar spec but a completely different design, or the higher-spec 7390. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:46:09	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		false

40772432	From the Palm Pilot days to my last Samsung Infuse Android.. I have had a lot of devices and Smart Phones.  The Lumia 920 is a very well made phone with a fantastic screen.  My first few days with it were wonderful, the OS is a joy to use.  Easy to navigate but full of features to make things interesting.  No slow downs, freezing, or resets.  The choice of fonts, contrast, and screen clarity make it a joy to use.  Then on day four I only made it thru half the work day...  never had a battery die so quickly.  I turned off wifi on day 5 and made it thru work and almost home before the battery gave up.  No video use, a little music, a blue tooth headset, phone calls, a few small searches on the net, check weather and it's almost gone.  I would have thought it was a bad phone but I'm seeing other users with battery issues (that they say improve over time).  The only thing I'm sure that time cures is return rights.*** UpdateEnding up keeping the phone and yes the battery life improved.  I'm not sure why and I've never had it happen on a phone before, but it was like it needed a few charges discharges to get it's full power.  I would now rate this phone 6 stars (If I could).  Some reviews will say it's heavy, no it's very well made and solid. The first phone that I think could survive everyday use and drops without a case.  Plus we are talking ounces here, heavy really...  Best screen I have ever seen (and the Infuse was great).  Clear, bright, vibrant, easy to read, and no glare.  Everything just works and works well. The auto adjust on brightness is the first I have been able to leave on.  Most phones try to stay on the dim side and then adjust at odd times for no reason.  I never notice the Lumia adjusting, it just seems to pick up the correct brightness for the conditions and stays there.  I'm in computer support so I see a lot of interfaces.  The Lumia Windows OS is fantastic.  Anyone who picks the phone up understands the interface within minutes.  Microsoft looked at the existing systems and then designed one for actual smartphone use.  It's not complicated or 10 levels deep, so everything is close to the main menu and easy to get to. No lags or slowdowns on this phone, movement is crisp.  Everyone knows the camera is the best on any smartphone so that was a given.  Low light shots are great and the camera stabilizes so well it looks like you used a tripod.  Daylight shots are no better than any other high end smartphone but the video and low light shots are where it shines.  Great Job Nokia and Microsoft 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:50:52	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		false

66956176	I bought this phone through Net 10, and it lasted 7 months. For a phone that costs almost $200 it's a piece of junk. The phone had to be constantly turned off, or had to be completely taken apart to make sure that it was off, before restarting it. On the last day that it worked, I was charging it, when it got super hot, and then it made a pop sound. The screen turned on once, and I noticed that the screen was covered in what looked like ink inside of the screen, then it turned off, and that was it. I'm extremely disappointed as I tried to get through to NET 10 but I was never able to get a hold of customer service and my emails have not been replied to. I'll never buy another Motorola phone and since, I cancelled the other two phones with had with Net 10 and bought new phones with another company. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:55:29	Complaint	Unable to Use	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Display		false

65012904	I purchased this phone, so that I wouldn't have to deal with paying a phone contract. While it is tons better than my old Nexus S, it has one fundamental flaw. that my Nexus S didn't. While the Nexus S had the same amount of ram as the Xperia SP (16 GB), the Nexus S would allow me to move programs from the main phone memory to external phone memory. Something about the way that Sony handles their memory will not allow that to happen. I verified this on both my phone (Xperia SP), as well as my friends Xperia Z1. Then I tried to download about 4 or 5 apps that will allow this increased functionality. They all failed, and came up with either an error message, or the section that would allow you to manage the memory was faded out. Sucked! Great phone otherwise, oh and the other issue is that the camera seems to have issues focusing. Other then these two short comings, i'm happy with the phone. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:59:44	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

65265320	(Some background: I have had an EVO for more than a year now. I also have an iPad 2 and had spent enough time with an iPhone 4):: First things first ::This phone does not has as many apps as iPhone and it is not as flexible as an Android. However, it is fast, easy to use, simple and elegant which puts it in its own category. So, it is pretty similar to an iPhone in terms of user experience, but instead of every app for its own approach that Apple takes, Microsoft goes with every app is part of the system. And believe me, it works so well that you can't believe how Windows Phone 7 (WP7) is not getting the attention it actually deserves.:: Pros ::- Timely updates + Good looks + ReliabilityAll without the ugliness of Blackberry OS. My wife had a Blackberry before and new Blackberry phones are just not on par with others. So, she wanted to get an Android but it was quite impossible to find a good looking one that is smaller than 4 and even when you find some, they were almost always slow as hell thanks to the crapware (I'm looking at you Nascar!) and skins HTC/Motorola/Samsung loves to put on them. Where as this phone provides a fluid vanilla OS experience with a couple of HTC and T-Mobile specific apps that, by design, cannot get in your way.- The OS is directly supported by Microsoft, not manufacturer.This means, like iPhone, she doesn't have to wait for update to be released by HTC like I do with my EVO.- It already has most of the popular appsAnd they are considerably high quality. This is mostly due to the Microsoft's involvement with major apps and also because there are no fragmentation issues since WP7 imposes certain hardware specs and the OS is the same regardless of the manufacturer.- Solid construction and good looks.With its unibody design, device feels solid in hand and seems like it can take daily physical abuses (dropping, scratching, bending etc.) without a hitch.- Elegantly beautiful and smooth UIWhoever designed WP7 interface clearly put a lot of thought into it since it is both modern, simple and easy-to-use. It takes 5 minutes to get a hang of it and my wife hasn't looked at any manuals or anything to use it. The butter smooth animations, quality on-screen keyboard, responsiveness... you get the same feeling of smoothness throughout the whole device. Although, keep in mind that the interface is not as customizable as an Android.- 2-level dedicated camera button!I don't understand how this is not common practice but having a dedicated button is great. It also has the screen-tap option, if you like it the other way, but it's just disabled by default.- Bing integration works wellBuilt-in Bing services allow you to make live translations and product searches from camera snapshots, search local places around you, make voice activated searches, song recognition and possibly more. You want to see reviews of a book? Show it to Bing and it will tell you. You saw a Franch movie poster but don't know French? Take a picture of it and Bing will recognize the words and translate it for you. You can do the same things on other phones as well but it's just too easy and simple on this one. No extra apps needed either.- (Update 12/13) Battery performance is very good.This phone can make it through 2 full days with low to moderate usage with default settings, and my wife doesn't even bother to turning Wifi and GPS off. For a long time EVO user like me, this performance is a lot more than good. WP7 also provides some advanced battery saving options but we haven't tried that yet.:: Cons ::- App Market is still smallIf you can't live without hundreds of different apps with tons of alternatives for each of them, look somewhere else because Market is still in its infancy. There are not a lot of options for everything and apps that already exist are still getting used to concepts of the Metro UI. However, the apps that currently exist would satisfy users for most if not all use cases (twitter, facebook, games, whatsapp etc.)- Camera is good but not as good as an F2.2 should beEven though it's better than most and lens being F2.2 (like iPhone 4s or Galaxy Nexus) provides a good low light performance, the quality is not on par with latest Samsung or Apple devices, especially under low light.- (Update 12/13) Non-expandable memoryAlthough the 8gb built-in memory should be more than enough for most users, if you want to keep your whole music or movie archive with you, look somewhere else.:: Wrap up ::All in all, if you are looking for a solid, beautiful phone that provides a reliable and consistent experience with the most modern interface on the market, you can go with this phone and believe me, you will not regret it.(Update(12/13): Cleared some things up and added some extra information) 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 04:59:44	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

It can be used with any prepaid or post paid service.I hope Apple make this product available at lower prices to help people who genuinely need to travel abroad on a frequent basis.Hope this helps. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:03:30	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64885610	This phone is amazing. The design, the screen, the camera. And also the feel of it. It was amazing. The reason I am giving 3 stars rather then 5 ids because one day I was using the video camera and the phone just froze. By the way this phone had no problems before. Well after it froze, I tried everything. Soft reset, hard reset and even took out the battery and charged it, but the phone does not turns on at all. And I mean nothing happens. So I called Samsung and guess what they said. The person who works there told me that the Samsung company in the U.S.A. does not fix international phones and that if I want it fixed I would have to call the company in China. So I decided to take it to a repair shop and they said the same thing. So yeah, great phone and all as long as it works. Once it stops working, its difficult to get it fixed. My advice buy the Galaxy S2, just not the international version. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:05:45	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	Replacement	Hardware	Camera		false
61857998	It`s so useful!! The camera it's great!! Texts and calls works very well!! I din't use an extra memory yet but with only 8gb internal memory it`s support a lot of information (pics, video, voice note, apps...). The size is ok, not too small, not too big. It has some interesting skills as the written notes, you can write anything in your phone and save it anytime you need it. If you're a writter or productor that skill keep very well those ideas you get in the subway, for example! It has differents way to save battery. I charge it once at day only.

So I will not go into that kettle of fish.The two phones I ordered direct from Amazon as the seller came quickly and in perfect condition.  I hate being on contracts so I wanted to be able to change carriers at will.The phones were easy to setup.  Before going over to ATT to get the micro sim cards I charged them up and joined them to my wifi network.  Software updates from Microsoft and Nokia were installed just fine.  I did it this way so I could be in and out of the ATT store quick.....and it worked.We are both very pleased with 920.

26251195	I overall like this device, which I switched to from iPhone 4. The bigger screen size seems a bit odd at first, but it grows on you fast, and pretty soon I couldn't imagine going back to the smaller iPhone 4 display.The processor and memory are pretty fast, no complaints there. I like the fact that it boasts a file system, so it's possible to save files and email them later on for example. It also has the ability to open, edit, and save MS Office files, which is great. Google Talk works nicely too, compared to iOS where third party for fee apps just don't seem to be able to cut it.On the downside, the speaker phone volume is lower than other mobile devices I've used. And battery life, while not bad, is not great; practically one has to charge it in full before stepping out of the house, and usually plug it back in first thing upon coming back. I read reviews saying the screen is fragile, but so far it's worked fine for me (have had it for a couple of weeks). 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:12:03	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		false

66383582	After less than a week of owning the original LG Chocolate, I traded it in for the LG enV and have been satisified every since.  I've had it for over 2 years and the battery charge is exactly the same.  It functions properly no matter how many times I've dropped it.My main uses for the phone are:- calling- texting- pictures- videos- record sound- gamesI don't use it for music so I can't review it in that regard.  I don't have problems with calling or texting.  The pictures have great quality and I just email them to myself so I can keep them forever because I'm too cheap to buy an SD card.  The videos are decent quality but I have a digital cam if I really need that.The thing I didn't like was when the Chocolate had come out, I bought a game and it wouldn't work.  I have bejeweled and I play that on my phone whenever I'm bored or waiting in a long line. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:12:03	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
64144053	I'm an ATT fan for a long time and I own both I897 and I997. I897 is very similar to I997 in many ways except for the smaller screen and new body style. Both phone performs well on speed, screen quality and battery life. What I did not like about the I997 is the sound quality and low resolution. For having a bigger screen the amount of icons you can place on the screen are the same in I897, Basically the screen just got bigger not much sharper or better. Plus it's hard for me to carry the I997 in my pocket because of the size. What nice about the I997 is when you read txt, emails, and books because of the large screen. All in all I like both phones, I897 for games and other stuff and I997 for txt, emails, web and reading books. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:14:14	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false
65910845	Update 01 April 2011:I have to say that I just LOVE this phone!  The battery life, with stock battery, has been fine since I used the application to make 3G dominant: it certainly matches the battery life I had with my two Blackberry phones.  The phone is smooth and has worked flawlessly for me.  The editing text interface (using a little bar to find where your cursor actually sits) is a very handy and thoughtful upgrade for when you want to place the cursor in an exact spot.  Again, it's only been two weeks but I have no regrets.  After having had four types of Blackberry, the HTC Incredible (screen sucked in bright light), the Droid X (crummy interface), etc., this is THE FIRST phone I've had which--after two weeks--I can honestly say is THE BEST PHONE I'VE EVER HAD!Update 25 March 2011:Very happy with my Thunderbolt!  As other reviewer have noted some engineering type things (kick stand that in one position affects micro-usb jack) and a small power on/off switch stand out.  I just LOVE the HTC Sense UI much more compared to the crummy one on the Droid X.  The contacts manager function is much better and HTC's Footprints function is extremely handy as I drive to dozens of different fire stations.As another poster wrote to me, there is an easy free application that gives you access to the phone's functions and allows you to control if you're 3G of LTE.  The link to the application is:  [...]I downloaded it and it works quite well! Apparently doing the above will enable HTC Thunderbolt users to conserve battery life 4-fold and gain up to eight hours on a full charge with regular usage when not using a battery efficiency app.So there you have it, give it a go and feel free to let us know how you get on and whether you experience better battery life from your HTC Thunderbolt by posting to our comments area. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:14:14	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

59565509	I've had the opportunity to spend time with almost every smartphone on the market. This is the best phone I have ever had in my hands. The build quality is superb and highly durable when compared to its peers. It fits very well in the palm of your hand thanks to its curvature. The screen is a gorgeous 720p display with deep blacks, vibrant colors, and a 60hz refresh rate that's buttery smooth.Nokia threw every feature in this beast they could think of. Optical Image Stabilization, which allows the phone to compensate for tiny movements and also makes it possible for this device to take low-light photos you will not believe. It has HAAC microphones for recording sound up to 140db. If you every have the desire to record at a concert, this phone will give you the best audio hands down. Wireless charging, super-sensitive screen that can be used with gloves, NFC... I think I hit them all, but I may have missed something.Seriously, unless the size is a deal-breaker, or if you need to have Pandora or Instagram RIGHT NOW, then I strongly advise you to check this handset out. Nokia's craftsmanship rivals that of Apple's. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:14:14	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

29103345	Best things I love about the Nokia lumia 920 (and the previous lumia 900):- Nokia Music: Allows me to create a custom mix of music just by typing in the artist's name. It also allows offline download so that I can download it over wifi and then playback in my car. All I need is an FM transmitter to play it over my car's speakers.- Nokia Drive: Really neat for driving directions and GPS- Nokia City Lens: Augmented reality app that shows me the restaurants, shops in an area by just pointing the camera in that direction- Skydrive integration: Any photos are automatically uploaded to my skydrive account which makes them accessible from any other device that has a skydrive app.- Xbox live integration: Lots of games to play for free (trial versions)- Sturdy build, great screen size, excellent camera and sound clarity. I dropped the phone a few times and keep it in my jeans pocket...still no scratches.Here are some tips I use to maximize the battery life:1. Turn Off the location sensor (GPS) unless I'm driving and I need a GPS.2. Turn Off the WiFi unless I'm streaming music or downloading large files (like games, music, etc). For all other purposes the 4G LTE is really fast and I don't really need WiFi3. Set the phone to airplane mode before going to sleep (saves the battery and also reduces my exposure to cellphone radiation while sleeping). 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:20:13	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66484091	I got the MyTouch 4g after my MyTouch 3g was lost in a car accident (somewhere out on Interstate 71 my poor 3g sits in pieces after being flung from my car). Originally I was a little disappointed; my 4g does not have a keyboard (although now they do make a MT 4g with a keyboard) and I did not like the battery cover design. HOWEVER I love this phone.Battery life: A lot of people complain about the battery life however I have noticed I get 30+ hours with light usage (meaning checking mail four or five times a day, a few dozen texts, and roughly sixty minutes of talking), 15+ hours with medium usage, and 8+ hours with heavy usage.Camera: I love the camera on this thing. I also had to buy a new camera to replace mine lost in the crash but I use the camera on my phone more. The quality of the pictures is surprisingly nice, it's really easy to use and super simple to upload to facebook/twitter or add on to a text.Texting: Uh, I text all the time. A couple hundred texts a day at least. The only times my phone has trouble sending or receiving texts is when I'm suffering from spotty coverage, which usually only happens when I'm out in the mountains of North Carolina or West Virginia. Type touch keyboard is pretty easy to use once you get used to it. I love the amount of texts you can store as well. When I had the sidekick I could only store 100 texts and that just sucked.Internet: I spend a lot of my time travelling to rural areas so I don't always get the reception needed for internet, however in my home town I get fantastic internet on this thing. Pages load fast and look great on the screen. I usually don't bother using mobile friendly pages because it's not needed. Admittedly if you have two bars or less your internet might be slower and videos will be a pain to load, but with decent reception I haven't had a problem. I've noticed a lot of people blaming the phone for what I truly think are just reception issues, some areas just don't get coverage as well as others. I've also noticed that moving at high speeds (like on the interstate or on a train) can slow down your loading times.Mobile WiFi: I love, love, love this feature. I spend a lot of time travelling, like I said, so I'm not always in a place with reliable wifi. Also I don't always like using public wifi when working on more delicate things. With the Hotspot I can make my own password protected wifi network. I can even share it with a couple friends when I need to.Music: My iPod touch also got destroyed in the crash so I decided to try loading music on my phone until I could afford a new one. The sound quality is great and the interface for the media lab is really easy to use. The only problem is that listening to music on your phone will burn through the battery pretty quickly. Expect 7 maybe 8 hours if you are listening to music the entire time. However the phone does really well with playing music and then using the internet or other apps.Maps: I use my phone for a gps too, and it's actually pretty crappy for that. It's just not very accurate about where you are. The directions you get street by street are fine but if you're looking at the map it will tell you you are anywhere within like 500 meters of where you are, and on city streets that's annoyingly inaccurate. I mostly use it when I know my starting point and ending point.Apps: All my apps run great. Some of the bigger ones are slow to download or update but they run fine. I use apps for banking, gaming, reviews, organization, etc. I love the wide selection available, especially of free apps.SD Card: It comes with an 8 gb microsd card. I upgraded to 16 so I could store more music.Tips to extend battery life: Turn off automatic updating. This means you'll have to manually choose to Dl your emails and facebook updates and weather, etc. but it really helps to extend battery life.If anyone has anymore questions about the phone feel free to leave a comment and I will reply! 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:20:13	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false
66785094	This is a really nice phone, plain and simple; IMO, best you can get for the money without a contract. For starters, the screen is excellent. Deep, rich colors, good viewing angle. Hard to believe you can get a screen this good on such a low cost device. As a touch-screen phone, the dialer is responsive and the call quality is clear as a bell (in my area, anyway). For messaging, you get a very nice landscape mode qwerty virtual keyboard. Tracfone is pretty generous with their messaging allowance: 3 texts = 1 minute deduction. The mp3 player is also very good; I don't have one, so the ability to do double-duty was important to me. It has all the features you'd expect (sort music by artist, album, track, genre, playlists, album art, etc). You need a micro-SD card to load music, as well as a microUSB cable. Before you buy a new cable, try the ones you have. I was able use my Kindle cable, no problem. The phone includes a standard 3.5mm jack (nice), so you can use any earphones you want, from el cheapo to high-end. Using some pretty good-quality headphones, I did detect some background hiss when starting/stopping my mp3's, so if you listen to soft music, or classical, for example, you should keep that in mind. Also, be sure to create a My Music folder on the micro-SD and place all your music files there; that's where the MP3 player initially looks for your music. The phone does support apps, albeit not Apple or Android apps, but rather Java apps. Just search Google; there's plenty out there, just no central app store. The best way to load apps is with the data cable; download to your computer first, upload to the Other Files folder on the micro-SD (that location is important), then just browse to the folder on the phone and select the java .jar file. The app will install automatically, after which you can access it from the built-in Games  Apps tool. About web-browsing: let me say from the outset that I wouldn't try to use this phone for heavy web browsing--frankly, at 2.5G (Edge) it's just too slow and the screen is a little too small. But if you get the right browser, it's perfectly competent for light Internet access; I suggest Opera-Mini, which is pretty fast and includes its own virtual keyboard (the built-in browser only offers the T9 keypad; it's basically worthless). Tracfone is a little less generous for web access: 2 minutes of browsing = 1 minute deduction. You can certainly check the headlines, the weather, etc, and get off quickly without using an inordinate amount of your minutes. But I'm at a loss to understand why this phone isn't 3G, which would make browsing--even on the small screen--a whole lot more practical. I upgraded from a 2-year old samsung tracfone (just a basic flip phone) and even it was 3G! Go figure. I won't go into basic operations of the phone or built-in tools; other reviews cover that territory pretty well. I guess my only complaint is that you only get one home page for apps; the second home page is reserved for contacts, which I don't find all that useful. One more thing, the touch-screen is not capacitive like the iPhone, it's resistive, so you need to press it a little to make selections or scroll. It's quite responsive, but does take some getting used to. For scrolling, here's a tip: use your finger nail, not your finger tip. That way, you won't accidently select something. Oh, another tip, the default theme is cartoon; for a more grown-up look, select the black theme, which kind of looks like an iPhone. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:20:13	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

29376634	I have used iOS and also Android.  In fact, I just purchased a 3rd generation iPad and love it.  I bought this windows phone because I was curious about the new operating system.The phone itself is very well made.  To me, it is a great size.  not too big and not too small.  It has very clean lines and easily fits into a pocket.  The screen is very bright and easy to read.  The viewing angles are awesome.  I actually think they are better than the 920 when I compared them in the ATT; store.The operating system is very cool to use.  it's definitely a different experience than Android or iOS, but I believe a lot of people would really like it if they gave it a shot.  Everything runs fast and smooth.  It is a VERY easy operating system to get used to and enjoy.I really like the Nokia included apps, especially the mix music feature.  It's like Pandora, but you can download music for offline listening which I like.  I also like podcasts and it is easy to find and subscribe to my favorites.  There are plenty of apps out there to meet my needs.  The game selection is pretty good.I put a 32 GB micro SD card into the phone so I have plenty of storage.  I also like that there is a removable battery in case I need a replacement.All in all, I think it's a great phone and hopefully more people will give Windows Phone a shot. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:22:16	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
20949531	I thought that the new windows devices would be a good switch for me. I am a tech savvy person and understood in my switch to a windows phone that I would be giving up a lot of the apps and conveniences of the android market, however, I was not prepared for the absolute lack of functionality of the windows phone. Only sinks every other contact, terrible terrible terrible app market, won't work with zune(or the new xbox music) that is supposed to be such a selling point. The black lit screen with bright neon colors was constantly giving me a headache, even after I changed the colors of the tiles. It was impossible to scroll quickly to find the app you're looking for on the home screen because, although each app has an individual logo, most of the tiles are still the same color with a white logo, they all blend together and I found myself scrolling back and forth multiple times to find what I was looking for. I think the ideas and concepts here are innovative and smart, but unless you have a windows 8 laptop and tablet, they won't sync together. Stick with android, at least for the next couple years until windows figures it out. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:22:16	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Display		false

Sent the phone to customer care and delivered on February 26, 2014.As of today I have not received my phone and still company says they will send as soon as possible.Its very frustrating and waste of money as I end up paying phone bills without using the phone.

64510983	-Very problematic order from MileHigh Wholesale. Do not order from them.-Issues with company failure to fulfill my 1 day shipping order. item will arrive in 4 days, not 1 day.-Company webstore states they Ship in Colorado, package tracking info shows it is shipped from NY.-Company changed name from ET Hydrophonics to MileHigh Wholesale Inc. in CO.-Very upset that I selected this company from CO specifically so that my item arrives here in CALI asap bec. they were closer to CALI. but they are shipping the item all the way from New York.====================Now for the product review. I decided to stop by at an ATT store and purchased their Galaxy Mega 6.3.The phablet is very nice and quite portable. In terms of usability, it handles most app launches and background task without any hesitation. I noticed a very slight stutter from an HD 1080P video from Vimeo but it was hardly noticeable.I'm a hardware engineer and I think this would complement my work and entertainment consumption with just one gadget instead of separate units. As far as pocketability, It is possible to contain it inside a standard straight leg jeans. It could pose difficulty for someone having those skinny jeans and or silicone rubber cases due to the friction they create.I would definitely purchase another for someone in my household because of its double duty purpose. In addition, I'm a long time iOS user and this is my first time using an Android OS. So far, it is very impressive and quite user-friendly. Very happy with my ATT store purchase.Good: Good battery life, replaceable battery, pretty good screen, cpu is average,Not so good: slippery to holdBad: NO LTE support for Verizon or SprintI will add more info as I use the phablet 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:24:00	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Camera		false

I immediately put in the AWCC sim card and it works perfectly. Even the GPRS works with a minor setting change ( No 3G  where I am at).

22655890	Why is that THL's customer service IS THE WORST I have ever experienced in my entire life.  Phone completely doesn't work.  I bought the phone about a month ago.  Haven't even had the phone for a month because the shipping took so long.  Which is fine but then after 20 days of use the phone stops working.  All I get is some person named  Lilly Lilly  responding to my messages once every 2 days telling me to send jpeg format.  I sent jpeg video in several different formats.  I even have a video of the issue on youtube.com.[...]This has been going on for weeks.  THL does not want to help or correct the issue.  All they do is say thank you for sending a message and hope you dont respond back.  I advise anyone NEVER TO BUY FROM THL.  There return policy is a LIE.  There customer service is a JOKE - to say the least.  I'm Laughing to hard when I think of there year warranty on there phone.  LIES LIES. The phone was cool for 20 days with jelly bean and a seemingly fast quad core.  However you are taking a RISK with quality.So I ask again,Why is that THL's customer service IS THE WORST??? 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:26:45	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Internal Hardware		false
66652135	I got this phone on the 24 because i was eligable for my upgrade. This phone is amazing. Good features, easy to use and just overall good.Although i would like to have a removeable battery and an extra slot for memory cause it only gives you like 11gb. other than that it's awesome.This is a warning. Only use the HTC charger it came with. Do not use a different charger. I was charging the DNA with my friends charger because i was at his house and he has the razr MAXX andI didn't force it in it went in smoothly and in about 10min my phone became super hot and shut off. It wouldnt turn back on so iwent to my house and tried charging it on my htc charger that came with it. Nothing. I took it to the nearest verizon store and he told me i fried it. I had no idea that using a different charger could do that to a phone. Verizon is going to replace it so that's good but they were all out in all of the stores around me haha so there gonna send it in the mail.Awesome phone, just dont charge with a differen't charger. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:28:52	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		false

66602416	When these handsets work they are fantastic, but when you buy such an expensive device from such a well recognized brand you can't help but be incredibly disappointed when they simply don't work.Apparently the way in which they are designed has also created a major flaw. Many of the new batteries are slightly warped so that the battery doesn't actually make contact with the corresponding points on the phone. This means that not only will the phone not charge but it will also not even turn on.You could try to push the battery in to make contact but this is hardly a solution. We have 6 of these handsets and only 4 of them actually work.We now have to send them back to the supplier and hope that they will return in working order.Don't buy these unless they have been tested prior to shipping.Sort out your problems Iridium!!!!Here is the only article I could find that addresses this issue:(...)oops! link doesn't show.

65693867	I bought this phone from Amazon two weeks ago and I've been playing around with it since. In my opinion, this is the BEST Nokia phone to date. Now, before reading any further, I'll give some background information about me so whoever is reading this can possibly relate and continue reading OR not relate and move onto another review:- I'm a male, age 25-30.- Consider myself pretty technologically savvy (career is in IT).- Previous phones: Motorola Razr, then Nokia N95 8GB, and now Nokia N8.- Originally purchased an iPhone 4 16GB, but didn't like the feel of the phone in my hand (Nokia N8 has a better feel), and was not fond of the simplicity of the iPhone 4.- I like being somewhat different and not having a phone that the majority have (although if everybody started buying an N8 now, I wouldn't sell mine and get another kind).- Live in Canada (had a friend bring this over for me) and use this with Rogers Wireless and it works great!So here's a breakdown of what I like and don't like about the Nokia N8.What I LIKE about the:Camera- 12 megapixel camera takes great quality pictures! You can do normal view and also take widescreen shots.- There's a Nokia Panaroma app that stitches together pictures for you! Great for taking landscape pictures!- HD recording is amazing--the video and sound recorded is surprising.- There's a built-in lens cover that automatically opens up and closes unlike my N95.- Built-in image editing (i.e. no need for a Fat Booth app--you can edit yourself and edit even more things!)- Looking at pictures and watching video is great on the screen.Call Quality- Crystal clear. Didn't have a problem with N95, and same goes for Nokia N8Keyboard/Texting- Despite other people complaining about a lack of a qwerty keyboard in portrait mode, I actually prefer the numeric keypad using T9. The buttons are bigger, so it's easier for one-handed texting.Homescreen- 3 customizable homescreens. I use 2 though--one for apps, and one to see a list of my e-mails from Gmail and Hotmail, my notes/reminders, and the music player.Music Player- Very easy to use, FM transmitter works great.Syncing Contacts/Calendar- I was able to sync my google contacts and calendar using Mail for Exchange.Gorilla Glass Screen- My girlfriend prematurely took off the screen protector that came with the phone, and I freaked out thinking it would get imperfected before I got a chance to put on a different screen protector. Now, I'm actually considering not putting anything on it at all. There has been no scratches--anything and everything that has gotten on it was able to get wiped off.Maps/GPS- Free maps and navigation for life! GPS finds my location very quickly.- Ovi Maps is great and is constantly improving. They teamed up with TripAdvisor to give you a feature that will provide information on restaurants, shopping, sights, etc based on your location on the GPS---so you can read reviews of things that are close to you!Battery- I charged it fully before using and then discharged it fully for the second usage.- Takes about 2 hours on an empty battery to a full charge.- I was able to get 2 full days of moderately heavy usage on the phone before the battery ran out.- Now I try to keep the battery charged up as much as possible to maintain its life.What I DISLIKE about the:Call Quality- The other person on the other line sometimes reports hearing their own voice speaking, but I can't conclude whether this is the fault of the phone, or the wireless service, because it has happened just a few times.Vibration- Okay, well this isn't really a problem anymore, but I know other users have complained that when the phone is on silent/pager mode, the vibration when getting a text message is to quick and weak. Well that's because the default Ringing Type setting is set of OFF. You need to set it to BEEP ONCE and you'll get a nice long vibration alerting you of your incoming text messages.Music- There's not button on the sides to go control your music (I'm used to having accessible buttons like the N95), but it's not that big of an issue for me.Maps/GPS- There is no overview of all the turns/roads you need to take to reach your destination, which I'm sure (hopefully) they will add in a future update.Apps- Lots of people complain about the lack of apps, and so do I. But this phone is still new, and I'm looking forward to more and more development of different apps for it.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. I got what I wanted in a phone with lots of customization, great camera, and great build quality to last for some time. I hope my review has helped you out. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:34:12	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

64073821	I ordered the phone after viewing it on amazon. I was really excited about it that I even ordered one 4 my husband. The only thing was it didnt come with the earphone as promised  for some odd reason, it would'nt take charge anymore, not sure if its the charger or the phone thats faulty. I found out that it was the charger, it was faulty. I was not pleased with the phone as it says that it has Wi-Fi but unfortunately, it does not have Wi-Fi  the manual that comes with it is not the correct manual for the phone so you are unable to surf the phone  it does not take charge as it should as well as it shuts off sparingly, on  off. I really should've wait before purchasing another one for my husband, now Iam stuck with two non-working phones. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:34:12	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Features	Internal Hardware		false

64201477	I have updated this review, as 4G is working with me now. When I first purchased this phone, 4G didn't work. I tried everything I can do with no success. The 4G was enabled but no 4G signal. I searched the internet and found a way to access internal phone settings (special settings different from the normal settings) and found something called drx. I tried to change its setting and suddenly the phone restarted by itself, and when it caught the signal, wow ! 4G appeared ! I don't know what happened but it worked finally. But be aware that accessing these settings and playing with them may damage your phone if you are not aware of what you are doing.Going back to the phone itself, it is really a great phone that has everything I need; big screen, good resolution,  good battery, fast phone, fast connection - thanks to 4G. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:36:02	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false
66369698	This is basically the best phone I ever owned. Why? Because it has functions that I dreamed about having in my phone. I am not a multiple gadget guy, so I like having just one with everything. Nokia N8 does just that. It has a fantastic camera which rivals of even exceeds that of a regular point-and-shoot, powerful music player which delivers fantastic sound, all kinds of connectivity options: Wi-Fi, 3G, Bluetooth.......and most importantly the call quality. Its just better. Then again it has its drawbacks, like its hard to find stuff in the menus, but thats probably because I have this phone for about 6 hours. About the app store...Why do people complain about it? It has tons of apps that are functional, there are a lot that I would use everyday, not like the IPhone or Android (I had both). Those app store are full of junk, and not a lot of usefull apps. So thats about it. If you are willing to cope with not the best UI, and would like to see lots of features and have great call quality, then this is the phone for you. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:36:02	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
613289	Don't be deceived, this product is NOT as described. I9300 is #34;SPY CAMERA#34; brand. It says #34;White#34; and it arrived Black. 1st battery was charged, and I switched out to the second battery to charge it, and it required the whole phone to be reset. Lost the time/date. How long has it been since you ever had to set the time/date on a phone? The screen locks up when it #34;sleeps#34; and requires several power down selections before it #34;behaves#34; properly.

65140454	I'm generally pretty particular about smartphones, having  switched from an HTC One X to a Samsung Galaxy S4 prior to this little guy. But those were $800 phones. I get a phenomenal experience out of the Moto G for a fraction of the price.I play a bunch of games from Humble Bundle on it and haven't really found anything it can't do. I have an alternate launcher (Nova, which I highly recommend) and it's gorgeous. My battery life is usually more than sufficient, and I slapped an SD card in to hold game data and I have had no problems with that.I did disable #34;spotlight#34; and a couple of other cutesy Motorola features, but they didn't make it difficult to do that, and the #34;Google experience#34; is almost entirely perfectly pristine.It's the perfect size, and a great deal. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:38:33	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

10432355	I recently switched over to android from the iphone, and i have to say this was a good phone to introduce myself to the android with. Its a very nice phone and I'm begining to love google with all its features and seamless connectivity with all its applications.I did find a few cons:1. dust collect and is attracted very easily to the earpiece speaker on the top of the phone. Must clean regularly.2. the phone has a big gap on the top between the bezel and the screen, this is the design to make room for speaker, dust gets trapped in there very easily and if you do not clean it can eventually travel under the screen itself.3. the speaker on the back is easily muffled by just setting the phone on a flat surface or on your bed etc. so sometimes it rings very low because its being blocked. i think this was a design flaw. you would normally have to set it on its face to hear it ring properly in a noisy room.4. the speakers sounds are horrible and sometimes distorted if they are loud.5. music volume level is pretty low you cant really listen to your music as loud as you could on an ipod or any other music device.Pros:1. battery life is very good, way better battery life I ever got on my iphone2. the screen is superb, i really like the extra screen space and the vibrant color display3. get the latest android on your phone always before all the other models. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:38:33	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false
66771865	I don't usually write product reviews, but this scam is important for you, human being pals, to know.NOTE: If you are expecting to only be able to do calls and send sms, and you are happy with that, then this post is not for you.This post is for the people who believes this thing can replace an iphone, android, or soThe quality of the product in the outside is good, if not excellent, just as you would expect. If you see it at a store, you probably want it.The AMOLED display is just quite different so you will notice its vivid colors to be apart from usual LCDs, and it has good resolution.But...The software is the worst part of all. Nokia is unable to deliver good quality software. The so called Symbian (Anna, or v60, or whatever you want) are terrible pieces of code poorly written, in every aspect.Sumarizing, buying this, also includes (not listed above):- Random restarts (I've never saw my iPhone restart while doing anything...at most, the apps itself crashed...but even that wasn't often).- Unnoticed moments when you in fact can't make (and perhaps receive) calls. I won't go deeper, but I was very surprised to see that I wasn't able to call, and all my friends around me were able to do so. I had to restart the phone in order to solve this, so this is CLEARLY phone issue, not network issue (so don't argue in favor of Nokia).- Music player can't go beyond many songs when playing. It just crashes before you end up listenning to music, with an included restart (yes, everything that was open, goes to hell).Besides, you need to be somehow enthusiast about resetting your phone every once in a while.The first time was because (Ok, my fault) I mistakenly entered my Nokia account password. After that, an invisible app to the user in behalf of various nokia services (maps, store, social, exchange) was attemping to connect, but with wrong credentials, the only thing it was doing was to drain my battery cellphone. The workaround while I thougth I would find a solution, was to check my phone constantly for that app, and then close it.Ok, reset the phone!. Next, The music library wasn't able to load music correctly. No more than 800 songs or so. Ok. formatted microSD, phone internal memory, erase every trace of it in my Macbook, reset, and then restore music. Fine, it finally looks ok.But guess what? Now, suddenly, my installed apps manager is not able to show all of them. I cannot install apps from ovi store nor .sis files anymore. Ok, at this point you should be an expert in the resetting business: Format microSD, format internal, *#7370#, connect to WLAN, connect to ovi store, redonwload everything. Download maps, set voice assisted driving GPS. change positioning server from nokia to google (as their also-bad-written-code-for-positioning server takes forever to know where you are). Setup emails, Facebook, twitter, foursquare, re-sync contacts, re-sync music, photos. Go to camera, set maximum quality for pictures (why would I want to save pictures of 6 MP if the produced 8M pictures are 600 kb in size? Nowadays, that quantity is nothing). Set profiles, tones, screensaver to nothing....etc Done. Now what!!??? My smartphone is slow as hell. Ok, one reset more. Oh and by the way syncing music is a pain. Because the also-bad-written nokia multimedia manager is not smart (because the phone is the one that should be), and then uploads your songs, within nice folders ordered by artists and albums. But guess what? To open them, the phone needs to build a database...and to build it, it needs to read the WHOLE Sounds folder. Why in hell is not the desktop manager able to build this database while uploading files and at the end upload this database? It takes forever to sync music, and after that the Refresh library step takes another eternity. If you add a new song...be prepared, because your smartphone needs to scan all the Sounds folder again. It makes sense, because the phone doesn't know where the file was uploaded, nor the artist, nor nothing. So scan everything....right? So idiot approach...Really, really, really, please don't buy this as it's poorly designed software will make you hate this thing.Pre-answers:It is meant only for social things. Yes, but the preinstalled nokia social apps is crap. You will need to get/buy better apps. And guess what? Since Nokia didn't came up with push notifications, you need to have all your social apps open and connected (if this is your case, not mine), draining your battery.You can't expect a perfect OS. Even other brands has faults. Yes, but what about support? All you will find on internet is a bunch of another users asking for help in Nokia forums. Seriously, the support page only has obvious FAQs, and a forum. Nothing else. Just do a quick google for the problems I've had: SSO nokia application uninstall SSOUI nokia refresh library not working nokia cannot install apps nokia unable to install apps nokia (you'll find some unsolved posts from 2006!!). This is the proof that I'm not lying to you.Plus:-To capacitive touch sensor is not as precise as other phones. Be prepared to tap accidentally on things, since your thumb, which can't go anywhere while holding your phone, will cause this.-Hardware buttons can't be used while the phone is soft-locked. Seriously, why do I have 5 buttons in this thing if I can't even change to the next song while the phone is locked?? I had to buy an app for that....shame on me.-User interface loves to appear quick questions while anothers appear, so you will answer something to some question.-Downloads from web browser are automatic, if you clic on something that downloads anything, it will start automatically.-If you use earphones to listen to music, and change phone to silent, you won't hear any notification of calls, sms, etc. OK, thats abvious, profile name is silent. If you change it to general, then the sound goes to earphones and smartphone speaker. So, its your choice, everything or nothing.-If you don't upgrade to Symbian Anna, be prepared for buggy wlan connections (the settings say it wouldn't connect, but it will). With Anna, you reduce this weird thing to almost 0 (but not 0).-You will have to upgrade to Anna. Everything I said happens on Anna. The previous version looks like a Beta compared to Anna. And Anna looks like a Beta compared to anything. Picture that...-There are a lot of minor stupidities that you only say I couldn't expect less than that.I would return this, but unfortunately I can't as it came in a carrier plan.Anyone who wants to discuss this, be my guess. There is a quote in software development that says:Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot- proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning. Whether apple and google had already beaten the universe and their software is idiot-proof (including me), or Nokia can't win the universe. Of these options, I think there is a third one: Nokia is the idiot itself, not the users.One more: no wifi turn-off option. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:40:03	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Display		false

64967603	Hey I think mercedes are nice looking, feel good to drive but it seems that once you own one for any length of time the flaws start to show. The nexus 4 is alot like this.I bought two of these phones an 8 gb and 16 gb version.  As soon as I made my first call the problems arised.  There was static/buzzing in the earpiece.  So I go online and find out (despite the amount of five star reviews) that this is a common problem.  It seems like you can hear the processor even when not on a call.  I tell my self fine, it isn't the end of the world it is not too loud.Then the bluetooth problem came.  Granted mine wasn't as bad as alot of others but I always had difficulty syncing my phone with my car.  I would have to enable/disable bluetooth, re-pair etc.  Bluetooth in my car is important so I decide to use my free upgrade and get a galaxy s4 (I was originally going to sell whatever upgrade I got basically making the google phones free).  In all honesty the galaxy S4 didn't pair always that great either (come to find out my bluetooth is glitchy, car has now been replaced), but also online people complained about the nexus 4 and bluetooth.At this point I'm kicking myself in the butt thinking maybe I jumped the gun when it could have been my car the whole time.  Then it happened...My wifes phone would die with 27% battery remaining and the time would not update.  We had to reset the phone to get it to work.  Needless to say she also got a galaxy (S3).Outside of those problems listed above we liked the phones because it was easy to use as our first android phones and had a bunch of useful features (was less complicated then the galaxy), and was a no contract phone, so we didn't have the bloat ware on it.  It doesn't matter how great a phone is if it isn't realiable.  I just urge prospective buyers to research fully (not just read reviews here) before buying the phone. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:40:03	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

69137646	The hardware folks failed on this device. The only saving grace is the Windows Phone 8 OS.First, the device is entirely too heavy. What is all the weight for? I just don't know, because usually it's the battery that carries the bulk. And yet the battery life is terrible, as many other users have reported. I can charge in the evening, unplug when I go to bed, and have it at half-charge in the morning. What happens overnight? Gremlins use my phone?The camera is as mediocre as other phone cameras I've used. Takes too long to focus, the flash is very spotty and the colors are underwhelming. I know some folks are very pleased with it, but I don't understand how it's better than any other camera-phone.The one thing it does well is run the OS well (while using too much juice). I really enjoy Windows Phone 8, especially the integration with cloud services and social networks. Messaging, email and web all work very well with smart features that don't add bloat or leave me wanting for functionality. It's a very nice refinement of WinPhone 7.After six months with this device, I'm afraid I won't make it to the end of my two-year contract. I may just go back to my Samsung Focus. The weight, battery life and fragile screen are tough to bear. I could live with WP7, if I had to. Next time, I'll go back to Samsung for a Windows phone. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:40:03	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

19683016	The phone is nice and has all the basic necessities. It looks pretty sturdy too. It is dual sim. It is NOT touchscreen, but it is colored. Color is vivid and I love that you are able to see many lines of the message at one view.The reviews do not match what is being shown (I realized this before the purchase but I needed a basic phone) and I'm not sure what particular related product it is that is being described that has Skype and all. This phone does NOT have wi-fi connection but is mobile internet-capable via GPRS. I haven't been able to test the water-proofness yet.It arrived on time and in a package that fits the mailbox. I think it sat inside the mailbox for a couple of days that when I opened it, the phone was a bit hot. The outside of the phone is made of shiny metal alloy that seems to respond to the temperature of the environment pretty quickly. If its cold, it would be cold too.I also found it very hard to open the back of the phone to insert my simcard. It takes a bit of time to figure out and some effort to take the back cover out.It does not come with a memory card, and unless you have a memory card the camera/photos and music are useless. The camera photos are very low res anyway.To sum it up, its a good phone as it allows you to do the basic stuff, but you cannot expect too much from it. Its good for back-up. I use it for my roaming simcard when traveling. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:47:10	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

The QWERTY keyboard is tiny, even for my small fingers, and key spacing is cramped.  Both outgoing and incoming calls were dropped 80-90% of the time.  My husband and I are with the same carrier so we tested calls at the same time to see if it was a carrier issue and found it was this phone.  This was definitely a learning experience. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:55:30	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false
64438478	I got this phone as part of a rebate deal, trading in my trusty T-mobile service (and venerable black and white Motorola V66) for this shiny colour phone with Cingular's More bars in more places network.In both regards I've been disappointed.The Samsung x427m phone, first of all, does not come with an earpiece. This fairly inexpensive addition would have added tremendously to it's usefulness, and assuaged fears about radiation (see below).The phone has a tendency to interfere with speakers; I can only guess that it emits more radiation, such that it provides sufficient signal to drive the speakers. As it stands, it is aesthetically a minor annoyance to hear the speakers buzz occasionally when you bring it within 10 feet of a speaker, but the hidden health problems could be more serious. I am sure it is within the legal limits for radiofrequency emissions, but it still a little disconcerting nonetheless.You would think with increased emissions you would get better signal quality, but that is not the case here. Roughly 10% of my calls have to be redialed because for some reason or other the reception is so poor I can't make out what the other party is saying. Occasionally my voice gets so distorted over the phone that my friends cannot recognise my voice.The phone itself is not particularly user-friendly. It is not simple to save a number to the phone if someone dials using a new number to you. The number shows up, but there is no option to simply add the number to your phonebook. You need to retype it in to add it under an existing or new entry.The ringtones are either annoying or barely audible. I have missed quite a few calls because my phone was in a jeans pocket, and the material absorbed the sound. If you listen carefully though the music is quite nice.There are some good points about the phone. The games are quite neat; the chess is way too easy, but otherwise the games are quite playable. The battery lasts for quite a long time; it'll probably last 5 days with light use. The phone feels pretty solid and I've dropped it a few times without much consequence.Overall though this is a phone to give to your school-age kids. It won't make too much noise to disrupt classes, as you can muffle it with clothes, it doesn't have a camera so you won't worry about the issues associated with that. The interface is sufficiently cumbersome that you can enter the numbers permitted for dialing, and not worry too much about your child adding all of their friends. It looks nice enough that your kids won't look like they're carrying a brick or some obsolete product to school. It's light enough that it won't overload their schoolbag, and doesn't need to be plugged in every night so they can be a little lazy about maintenance. It's cheap enough that if you lose it, you can just get another one.Just teach them Morse code so that when you can't hear them you can still communicate by pressing the buttons. Oh, and pack a metal helmet to block the radiation. Then you're all set! 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:55:30	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

75516620	For an almost 2 year old phone, it still feels pretty darn modern! I've had one since it came out, and I bought one for my husband back in February because he was sick of all the issues with his Samsung and Motorola Android phones: poor bluetooth connectivity, constantly freezing, poor battery life, he always complained that it felt cheap (like it was about to fall apart, from day one), apps always crashing, frequently rebooting itself. The list goes on. We both love Windows Phone 8, and even upgraded to 8.1 under the Developer Preview program. It's fast, reliable, and smooth. You really have control over the bulk of the phones functionality, including what apps can run in the background. Mine, as I said is 1.5~ years old, and the battery is just as reliable (maybe a little more so with recent updates) as when I first got it, and I use it pretty heavily on a daily bases, especially when traveling. I have never once placed a screen protector on it, because I hate how they make the phone/screen look.  I have had people knock it out of my hand, kittens run across it full speed with claws out, dropped keys on the screen (accidentally when putting them in the search-bin at the airport), and it only has 1 scratch on the screen. Just one, that you can only see at the right angle. We both love this phone, and plan to get the next #34;version#34; of it when it comes out (hopefully towards the end of the year; Bing/Google Nokia Goldfinger or Nokia Mclaren). This is a true Nokia phone; it breaks the floor, not the other way around. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 05:58:02	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65974448	This phone is a good phone for keeping up with emails, and making calls, and texting.  After about a month of owning this phone, it would freeze up and take about three minutes to open a text, and if you were unlucky (like I was a lot) you would have to wait another few minutes before it let you input text in the message.  This phone also has an awful GPS navigation system in it.. It is a great back-up phone, but you are better off with a newer smart phone that is on the market. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:00:22	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

65075753	I have been using smart phones since 2004 and owned Pre since the first week that it came out. Now after almost two months, I can't even think about living without this phone for one day. First two weeks I wasn't sure about my decision, but after couple of weeks I really started enjoying the phone. It takes a while to get used to it and learn how to use all the features of the phone. Also it takes a while to get used to the keyboard. It's not as good as blackberry keyboard, but I don't believe it's a fair comparison to  compare Pre's keyboard to Blackberry's, since form factors and sizes are so different. I have had zero problem with the phone, and it works flawlessly with my exchange account at work. If you are going to buy the phone, make sure to get the touchstone as well. It makes your life much easier. I have been using it both at home and in my car, and I love it. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:00:22	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

I went to a store and the clerk showed me a few fantastic tricks I could do with this phone.  I need to go back and have him train me on these functions.  I love the size of this phone, I can actually see the screen without squinting.

My intentions in paying full price for the phone was to cancel my current cell phone provider, going to a straight talk plan. Cutting my monthly payment in half made the expense worth it.

66972639	Just follow the instructions on the card or paper in my case for your phone and you will have your 200 minutes in no time. It is a very VERY simple procedure! In a way I do wish that they would switch back to just allowing the user to punch in his/her own minutes over the phone as was the case in the past, but the newer varities seem a bit different and I am less unfamiliar with due to the fact that I have an android phone on a Verizon plan.

29222039	The Lumia 920 is the first smartphone that I have owned with a touchscreen that does not aggravate me.  It responds wonderfully to every touch.  I am constantly surprised how responsive it is.  Works with gloves, can download almost any location's map for navigation.Windows Phone works very well.  I am a former android user, and love many settings.  But I do not like freezes and not responding apps.  This phone has every setting that I have looked for, so far.  None of the Lumias have experienced lag or freezes.The wireless charging is a great feature!!!The camera is terrific, and City Lens is terrific.The phone is a little heavier than most phones, but its weight seems justified by the obvious build quality and rich suite of features.I switched from Verizon to ATT.;  I added a Lumia 822 to my Verizon account, but after being told that my unlimited phone would not be affected, Verizon cancelled my unlimited plan upon activation.  So I switched, then Verizon suddenly said it was all a mistake and my unlimited would remain.  My point, Verizon customer service is horrible and the 822 is also an excellent phone. I was quite happy to try his/hers 920's and stay with ATT;. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:05:18	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false
87905779	I bought 2 of these phones and for the 1st DNA, within 2 weeks the SIM card had to be replaced. For my 2nd DNA, within 3 days the SIM card had to be replaced. The 1st phone is still having SIM card problems. But since the phone is past the 14 day satisfaction guarantee, Verizon wants to give me a refurb phone. Which we all know is just someone else's problem phone. This phone had to be restarted 18 times between 4pm  6 am just to get the phone to work when the SIM card messes up.I have read on Verizon's site about numerous people having this problem.Buyer beware of this phone. Yes, there was an update the phone just did but it didn't fix the SIM card problem. I'm still dealing with HTC to get something resolved. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:05:18	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	Recall	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false
22349581	This phone has surprised me.  I have owned lots of Android phones and this one might be my favorite yet.  I NEVER thought I would say this about an LG phone.  To put it in perspective, I have owned the Galaxy Nexus, S3, Rezound, Razr and Razr M.The one area where this phone really shines is reception.  The Galaxy Nexus literally could not pick up a signal at my house, the S3 was not much better and the Motorolas had a solid 3G signal but barely picked up a 4G signal.  This phone has been on a 4G signal over 90% of the time.  Calls are crystal clear too.  Not sure why the LG has a stronger signal at my house than any of the other phones but it does.The IPS HD screen is awesome too.  Much better screen than some of the more expensive phones...It comes with some delivered themes.  The Thor one is especially cool.It runs fast too.  It had some delays when I first started using it but that has cleared up.  I deactivated quite a few of the delivered apps that I do not need.The GPS locks on fairly quickly but not as fast as the Razr M did.The battery life is average but good enough for me.  I am constantly around a charger if needed.  If you need great battery life and do not have access to a charger regularly, this might not be the phone for you.  On the positive side, the battery is user replaceable if needed.  There might be after market options for a different battery but I have not seen one yet.  It also comes with a micro sd card slot for expansion.  So many phones these days do not have either of these options.The overlay that LG uses does not bother me.  You could always use a launcher if needed.The phone would be even better with Jelly Bean.  Hopefully this will happen sooner than later but I doubt it since the sales of this phone will be small and not likely a priority for Verizon.  Plus LG has not been known for quick updates in the past.In my mind, LG has come a long way since even last year.  If you want a great HD screen and excellent reception on a budget, this phone is a great option. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:05:18	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

85153629	Nokia has always been on top with their amazing industrial design. They really have so many years of experience with different technologies, so when it comes to phones, they might know little bit more than all others. The fact that they've though of little details like using Lumia 920's screen with gloves on, pure-black screen settings etc. just gives them so many extra points in this smartphone war.I'm coming from iPhone 5. Which is a great piece of technology as well, but Nokia has something that makes it very friendly and fun to use. Combined with Windows Phone OS, the hardware and software are one piece of tech. A lot of phones suffer from marketing junk that is being added to the phone, cheap materials, inconsistency and just a lot of ugly little add ons that doesn't make it fun to use their products.Nokia Lumia 920 is beautiful. The bright yellow color makes it stand out. The fact that you only touch one setting of theme, and the whole phone changes to that shade is very smart and unique detail. Sure in Android you can add on 100 widgets (which will drain your battery faster and faster) but they're all inconsistent, look like they were made by a 5-year old and just add on nothing more than annoyance.App store is far behind Apple's iOS and Google's Play, which is the only thing that makes you go ohhhhh! with a sad face. It is slowly growing, but it will take sometime for a lot of different apps to do same thing I might want to do on iPhone or Nexus phones.What makes this phone amazing:-design-the way it fits into your hand-pure integration of software with hardware-a lot of user experience surprises that makes you wanna use the phone more and more-screen technology-camera lens-durability and recyclability-UI (user interface) is just like nothing out there-most important apps are there (not all)-originality and colorWhat can be improved:-faster update cycle and little bug fixes-more accessories and headphones-Bluetooth 4.0-more Nokia integration into their technology and services-top 10,000 apps and games must be available across all smartphone platforms.This one is for museums. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:07:49	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
66991387	Unboxing, initial configuration and getting the device to run have been smooth.The wall charger is very impressive. Small round design with a USB to micro-USB cable. Going with the industry standards, is always appreciated. Connectivity  Charging is a no-hassle game.Setting up the Windows Live account - smooth.Setting up Gmail (this is my primary email  and I want all my Gmail folders to push sync with my phone like on the Droid) - 3 step instead of 1, but I again appreciate the way Microsoft/Nokia have this configuration.To setup Gmail to sync your contacts, calendar  inbox is easy - just choose the Gmail option in the add account screen, tap in the username  password and you are ready to roll.But to have all your folders push sync'd- choose Outlook in the add account screen- tap in the email address  password. tap in sign in.- it will fail and prompt for domain. tap in gmail.com.- it will fail again and prompt for server. tap in m.google.com.- this will create your account. Get into the account settings  change the download new content setting to as items arrive... and you are done.- Installing/setting up Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Kindle, Whatsapp, Tango, Netflix, Office, X-box live is a breeze. I love the Need for Speed games series running seamlessly on my phone.Apps----Do not be in haste to install all the apps you can find. Its true, there is a lot of crapware in the Windows Marketplace  I seriously hope that Microsoft mops up the mess. Using appropriate filtering like Top Free, Top paid, Featured will help. Also the App Highlights application details some notable apps. The Nokia apps are also well designed to work on this phone. The Nokia Creative Studio almost replaces Instagram. But as far as the camera is concerned, the auto-focus function need to be improvised. Surely a software/firmware update will fix it.I am not liking the Zune software to sync music or other content with my phone. I like to better manage using the file system than using a software (Zune) layer. I mean, the phone should show up on the computer (WindowsPC in my case) as a USB drive. But, I am sure to find a workaround soon, like bypassing the iTunes for my iPhone.I have been downloading, installing, configuring and messing around with this phone non-stop for over 6 hours now  the battery is still going strong. Too early to comment on the battery, but with Nokia's reputation I have no doubts of this one spicing up an entire day.Hats off to Microsoft  Nokia. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:07:49	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

1143261	Bought this phone directly from ATT last week as they were offering the wireless charging plate along with it.  Compared to my husband's SIII this device is definitely a bit more hefty (I just had to find something to complain about). But in all seriousness I love this phone. The call quality is great and the camera is just Amazing. Now it did take a bit to get used to the tiles and overall navigation but now that I have used it for a few days, I think it provides more of a richer user experience than Android. The Nokia Maps that can be used offline for navigation purposes are a plus. As a mom I also really like the kid zone feature as it helps control what my kids can access when I allow them to play games on the phone. Did I mention I am able to charge my phone wirelessly. Even though the build quality is great; I would highly recommend getting a case and a screen protector especially if you have kids that love to play with your devices and accidentally drop em. Wish I had purchased them while at the store but I did not get them as I thought the accessories offered were plainly overpriced and there was not much to choose from. Anyways have ordered a screen protector through Amazon (was def less expensive than  the ones being offered at the store, will most probably receive it sometime tomorrow...will share if it is worth the buy). Now with regards to a case, am still looking for one as I am yet to find one that I really like (open to suggestions) 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:07:49	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false
64540519	Note: I am work from home, don't leave home a lot, and seldom use my smart phone for more than calls.First off the good:I love love loved the phone!  The uber sexy AMOLED screen is awesome to say the least. I love the quality photos, the macro on the camera is awesome! The video quality is really impressive! Sound quality excellent! Signal reception WOW! Out at our lake property, where most phones struggle for a signal if they even get one... the signal reception was outstanding! I loved everything about this phone!  The phone is really easy for a newbie to the world of smart phones to learn. I would give the phone 5+ stars for the AMOLED screen!Also, the phone is wifi capable, meaning when we traveled to Aruba, I could sit in cafe that offered free internet and sign on to send emails, Facebook or use Skype etc.  Loved having the phone!  It also took excellent pics even in low light... as well as wonderful hd video!Here's the rest of the story....I received this phone for Mothers Day 2011. I named her Ame after her AMOLED screen.  Unfortunately by June 3G quit working. First, I called Verizon who walked me through a reset, explained about removing the battery blah blah blah.  The reset didn't last... so the next day, I called Samsung directly because they are the manufacturer.  The Samsung Tech walked me through a different reset than than Verizon had prior and subsequently walked me through .... but still sporadic 3G at best! I then started the Verizon tango... after the reset, I would have to wait for 24 hours or so to make sure that it was no longer working, call them back dance one more time and finally after a couple of tries with Verizon in June, Verizon finally sent a new-to-me phone (factory refurb... which btw irritates me to no end). :-/After receiving the first replacement phone (my 2nd Fascinate) all was good; for about 3-4 or so months... just long enough to momentarily forget why my phone was replaced to begin with. I cannot remember exactly when I started noticing that my cloud service was sketchy/intermittent and that I was missing texts (using Google Voice)as well (I rarely text so it took a while to realize I wasn't getting any). Sometimes I would find my stuff uploaded just fine.. then not so much. I had even emailed the cloud service and Google to complain about their service... boy was that embarrassing on my part. Sigh... Anyway, life was very hectic in November but finally the light-bulb went on in my brain, I connected the dots and called Verizon to complain about my phone in December (busy busy holidays) Come January, they finally replaced my phone (my third Samsung Fascinate) due to poor functioning 3G issues.This third phone arrived around the 15th of January and only lasted about two weeks... texts from Google voice were sporadic, and my Navigation crashed every time I tried to use it... regardless of whether I was using Verizon or Google Maps.  I again had to start the Verizon Tango, the reset etc didn't work... the minute I fired up GPS or tried to go on-line... crash!Now, I really had a hard time deciding to give up on the Samsung Fascinate, I still say Samsung has the sexiest most vibrant WOW factor screen out there!  Uber easy to use even for a newbie!  But when the Verizon tech gave me the out... Finally after an extra 12 hours to decide... dumped the most beautiful phone I have ever owned!  Feb 1st marked the beginning of a different brand android phone relationship.Note:If Samsung gifted me one of their newer ones with AMOLED, just to give them a second chance... I would love to accept, just to see if they've worked out the problems.  But I won't shell out any hard ca$h for another Samsung after three strikes! 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:11:45	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64969142	When I received the Z3, I liked what I saw. Then after awhile I realized that the speaker was not working. In the following weeks I had to make numerous attempts to contact webtreo about the problem. They did eventually take the phone back and gave me a full refund, but not until I had made several attempts through both email and phone to make this happen. As for the phone, it was great aside from the malfunctioning speaker. The best feature was the mini usb charge plug allowing any mini usb to charge it anywhere. The SD card slot in under the battery cover which is inconvenient for changing it or taking it out. And the buttons were not very satisfactory. Other than that, an all around good phone. I would just suggest if you want to buy one, get it new. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:11:45	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

56205877	I just purchased this phone and it is by far the best phone I have ever owned. There are many reasons:1) Love the physical specs and how it fits in my hand. The 920 is very sturdy, and at 6.5 ounces, I actually like the weight of it. Some folks say it is too heavy, but I think it is just right.2) The Windows Phone 8 OS is fantastic. It allows for the most personalized home screen experience, much more than the IPhone or Android, which both seem cold in comparison.3) Kids corner is great for folks with kids. It allows you to have a 'kids' section that allows them to play games, listen to music, whatever you decide to allow. As a parent of yound kids, this will be fantastic for long car rides. They can't get into any of your mail clients or send texts.4) The camera is the best out there for smartphones, with an 8.7 megapixel Carl Zeis lens, with Pure View technology. Couple that with Optical Image Stabilisation and a 4.5 inch gorilla glass screen, the pictures and video are amazingly clear, especially in low light conditions. My kids play sports and it takes amazing action shots.5) Dolby sound lets me listen to music in style.6) Windows Phone 8 has plenty of apps, inclusing 46 of the top 50 best selling apps today on Android and IOS.7) Too many others to mention:)I just love this phone! Great job by Nokia and Microsoft for teaming up to make a best in class phone.  The biggest issue is it appears hard to keep this phone is stock. If you try this, you will love it. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:13:26	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

66129389	This phone is pretty cheap quality. It lets you listen to music while you do other things like text, but the catch is every time you hit a button or change screens the music skips. Its slow when texting, even without playing music in the background. Its very slow to send picture messages. I know no phone can send a pic message as fast as a regular text, but my old LG Octane was much faster. I like the design and features and just how the phone is set up in general, but its slow and glitchy which pretty much ruins it. I wish I hadnt broke my Octane, I dont think I can handle this phone for 2 years. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:14:43	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		false

18625653	Pretty sweet looking and feeling phone actually.  But, it breaks sooo easily.  The screen of the phone extends all the way around the corners of the phone, so if you drop it on the #34;corner#34; of the phone, you are actually dropping it on the screen and it will shatter.I had insurance so i had the opportunity to break this phone 4 times.1) slid off the roof of my car while parked on a steep incline (really only a 5 foot drop)2) stepped on it while trying to remove my pants (it was in the pants pocket)3) pushing a door open with my hip as I was holding a large object (phone was in my pocket)4) tackling a guy who tried to steal it.Needless to say, Asurion no longer lets me enroll in their phone insurance plans hahaYou may be less reckless than me, but I HIGHLY recommend getting a case for this thing as it is fragile.Then again, the only reason to get this phone is for the sleek design, which a case will ruin, so just don't get it. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:16:28	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Display		false

64435497	After I read this consumer alert, no way will I use Strait-Talk. Read and decide for yourself.Buyer BewareA good number of Straight Talk customers reported to Newsbeat Epicenter a variety of horror stories in conjunction with this cellular company. So Newsbeat Epicenter ordered the Samsung Glaxy Proclaim/Gingerbread 2.3 and the Samsung Galaxy Precedent Gingerbread 2.3 to experiment with. First of all the Android 2.3 is pretty amazing plus there are over 600,000 apps you may be interested in with many of them free of charge and others mighty low cost.However, unboxed, these Straight Talk handsets claim unlimited talk, text and data. As it turns out the talk and text have been unlimited with the Unlimited $45 load card. However, during our experiment our data slowed down to nearly nothing on both handsets in 3 week period of time. And when our techs called Straight Talk they claimed we used too much data so they drastically cut our speed way down. Straight Talk provided that the data is not at all unlimited as they claim. Well they refused to give us back our surfing speed and we were told we would not get back to normal until we renewsed our so-called Unlimited service the next month. So we did renew and our surfing speed went back to normal for a few hours then both handsets were deactivated because we used too much data. The one handset was reactivated yet we were warned about data abuse. The other handset was locked down entirely and we were told that phone could never be activated again by Straight Talk nor any other cellular company. By the way they charged us $53.08 yet deactivated our service about 12 hours later. We are seeking a chargeback of that money but have not received it as of yet. And we will not be receiving our money back for the expensive handset they locked down.So buyer beware! There is a catch to the Straight Talk unlimited data 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:17:33	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		false

21176622	Phone is fast, easy to use and it JUST WORKS!  No problems whatsoever with this phone.  Call quality is fantastic, reception is great.  Surfing the internet with the DNA is better than any other smartphone I have seen, not only due to the 5-inch screen but also the browser seems more like a 'real' browser than other smartphone browsers.  I don't know if this is something HTC is doing right, or just standard Android 4.1.1 browser - either way, it rocks!One of my fears in getting the DNA was aftermarket support.  This isn't one of the best-selling phones, so I was afraid that accessories like cases, screen protectors, etc. might be hard to come by.  I've had no problem finding accessories, they seem to be plentiful online and at the Verizon store, at least.I'm very happy with my DNA. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:19:44	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

65351252	I have one of these which I just de-activated and transferred service to a samsung T101g.  Tracfone provides excellent service, and by using Tracfone Wireless support on Facebook, you can take care of almost all of your phone issues.  The transfer of service took about 15 minutes and 3 emails, and it was done.  About the Motorola phone....it just wanted to be hooked to the outlet for recharge far too often.  With only light texting, and hardly any voice use, I could usually go only 2 days without having to recharge it.  I also found it a bit heavy and bulky to carry in my shirt pocket.  The Samsung T101g is just perfect for that.  One other thing.  I found the flip feature a pain in the butt when you're busy and have only one hand available to quickly open your phone.  A candy bar phone is much better for that.  So...in short...good phone, heavy on the re-charge, and a great company.....make sure a new phone you purchase will operate in your zip code....some won't.  Just contact tracfone to make sure. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:28:58	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

First, the battery does not keep a good charge if you do anything besides messaging and calling, but I have heard that most smart phones are like that. Secondly, it does not have enough phone storage use. Is there an app that I can download that will give me more storage space? I would like to find a free app, but if it is worth it to pay I will. Can my fellow consumers give me ideas ? I would most appreciate any help you could give :) 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:41:43	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

66026517	This phone seemed like it was taken care of pretty well--only tiny wipe scratches on the screen and it works fine. The only complaint would be that the power supply pictured in the advertisement was a big selling point for me (worth the extra $5), so I was disappointed when I got the little power adapter that takes *much* longer to charge with than the advertised large adapter. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:41:43	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		false

66927982	The Hardware==============Call Quality - Excellent (Typical of all Nokia Phones)The Build Quality - Excellent (Typical of all Nokia Phones)The screen - Good, vibrant, scratch resistant and repels facial grease, IS NOT GORILLA GLASS and is noticeably more fragile.Loudspeaker - A little on the soft sideThe Software==============I have been an avid Windows user since Windows 98, and a Windows Phone user since Windows Phone 7.Windows over the years has gotten more capable and much faster with time. Windows XP to Vista was a little buggy but it worked. Windows Vista to 7 was just a case of slothering Vista in butter and polishing it up to a fine sheen.Windows Phone 7 to Windows Phone 8 has been the experience nightmares are made of. It was basically going from Windows 7 to Windows 95.Windows Phone 7 was an elegant experience for me minus some minor quirks here and there. The most noticeable one was the inability to assign more than one mobile number to any one contact which was rather odd. Others were like not being able to multiselect files or difficulty putting ringtones and audiobooks on the device.They weren't deal breakers and there were some workarounds. That said, everything else in the OS was fully functional. The phones available has very limited storage, most maxing out at 16gbs. However as many figured out, the 1st generation WP7 devices uses MicroSD cards in place of soldered in onboard memory and with a little trick and the right SD Card, could take a 8gb phone and transform it into a 32gb phone. I did it with no problems on my 8gb Dell Venue Pro. Even better, integration with the Zune Desktop Software (ZDS) made syncing music, pictures, podcasts and videos to a lesser extent, a breeze.When i got home, I put my phone to charge, it would ping my desktop wirelessly, fire up the ZDS and start syncing my new podcasts and music automatically to my phone. When I left for work the next morning, everything just worked.Window Phone 8 is nothing like that. With this new OS, expandable storage is natively supported except on my Lumia 820 it doesn't work at all. When i put in my Sandisk 64gb MicroSDXC card, and fired up Windows Media Player to Sync my playlists as I did with my Zune and Windows Phones on the ZDS. (I did this with my old sandisk E250 player back in the PlayForSure days as well)My first thought, Wow this is slow!!Second thought, why is song taking to long to transfer?10 minutes later why is the same song still transferring30 minutes later oh *uck it frozeThen something that never happened on my WP7 Dell Venue Pro happened, my Music and Video app crashed, so did my settings app. On shutting it down, it was permanently frozen on the goodbye screen.I forced restarted it by removing the battery.When i powered it up, the SD Card was missing... I turned off the phone, removed the card and put it back in, powered the phone on and it was still missing. I took the card out and put it in a card reader on the PC. The disc check utility detected an inconsistency on the Card and ran but found no errors. Once it was back in the phone, the phone saw it once more. I tried syncing a playlist again, it transferred on playlist and froze in the middle of another.This happened over and over. Then I quick formatted the card back in exfat on my PC and tried syncing playlists directly to the card without the phone between them. Every song synced perfectly.Once back in my phone, all the songs turned up but... for some odd reason, some songs would turn up with no artist or album information. If i resynced them, or copied them manually, they would then show with the correct info, but then other songs would start doing the same thing, to no fault of the songs themselves because they all worked fine on my Zunes and DVP.Using explorer to drag and drop lots of small numerous files, music and pics mainly, always results in some sort of freezing during copying.In the end I gave up although I was able to do some podcast subscriptions directly on my phone by changing my country to USA so I could have some sort of entertainment on my phone for when I was driving or waiting in line. This is still a problem because when I want to view podcasts on my TV or desktop while I work with my nice sounding speakers... I can't.Over the last 2 days something else has started happening which is doubly annoying. For some odd reason, my music videos and pictures have started duplicating and triplicating themselves.If i plug in the phone and navigate to the directory, there is only one physical file even thought the phone sees 2 or 3 of them.Whats worse is if I delete even one of the duplicates, all of the duplicates including the original are deleted.The Nokia Lumia 820 is a horrible phone===========================================This is coming from someone who has owned only Nokia phones his whole life aside for a Dell Venue Pro and an Ericsson and has been a massive fan of Microsoft's Zune Software and Hardware devices as well as the Windows Phone 7 line of devices.NOTHING works like it ought to and despite how much I loved WP7, I cannot recommend this phone to anyone out there.I cannot even return it for a refund because it was bought in the USA and I live in Trinidad and Tobago.If other Windows Phone 8 handsets give the same problem as this Lumia 820, I recommend avoiding them until Microsoft and the OEM's get their house in order and fix what was not broken in Windows Phone 7.5 to begin with. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:44:20	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Display		false

66897873	I ordered this phone and it came on time and the features it professed to have were indeed there. The battery life lasted about three days or more according to what it was being used for. The radio quality was excellent and one did not have to be searching to find radio signals, the phone did that for you, but using the radio is a feature that diminishes the battery power quite easily. The phone is sturdily built and the quality over all is good, the only two negatives are that the phone needs to be updated with wifi to keep with the times and secondly i did not get to keep this phone long as it was stolen from me at work. I guess i was not the only one loving it, so for those who wish to purchase this, go right ahead just keep it on you at all times. lol 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:46:22	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		false

64375582	Seriously, you can carry this in your shirt pocket and not feel it.It weigh's in at just under 118 grams. (Comparatively, the iPhone weighs 135 grams and is thicker.)It's powerful and even better with Froyo. The downside is Touch Wiz, Samsung's UI really slows this phone down and the bloatware is just crap, frankly.I'd go on about the awesome super AMOLED screen but just read all the other reviews about it.

They did, but they failed to tell me that it was a refurbished model.  It had dirt in the keypad.

66212463	I was only looking for a phone to make it through the next year of my contract after I broke my Galaxy S3. I ordered this phone new and it certainly did not come new. When I turned on the phone it did not automatically bring me to the easy set up. Furthermore, there was already a video loaded onto the phone. I did a factory restore and after that it was easy to set up.As far as the system goes, it is a bit slow for me. It's only running on Jelly bean 4.1.2 and Motorola currently has no intention of updating this. There is no default was to manage tasks or save the battery like higher versions of Android have so I downloaded apps to do replace this feature. Most apps are compatible with this version of Android however, I have encountered a couple which were not. These apps were simple maintenance apps and again easy to replace. Perhaps, I am being a bit high maintenance myself, but I think it's important to know the few restrictions on the phone.All in all, it will suffice but there are certainly a few sacrifices made for the purchase. 	sheehan3	10-27-2015 06:48:39	Complaint	Unable to Use	Software	Recall	Applications	Software		false

65456292	I've owned my Treo 600, bought via Amazon, for about 4 months now and I am really enjoying it. I had previously owned an old Palm V, and then an HP Jornada, but found, lacking a utility belt, carrying a PDA in addition to a cell phone annoying to the point that I eventually abandoned PDA use. The Treo has brought me back.As a writer, I've been able to work on manuscripts (via QuickOffice) any time, any place (indeed, I probably did 25% of the editing for my latest novel on my Treo) which in invaluable. The phone functions clearly, and the camera lets me take photos (albeit low-res) on the go, which is handy to capture family moments and work diagrams equally well.With the free CoreMedia player, DVD/AVI conversion software, and a 1G card, I've even been able to take my favorite movies with me on the go, and watch martial arts instructionals any time.Only downsides are the lack of higher screen resolution and the inability to preserve data when fully discharged. I understand these are both fixed on the Treo 650, so perhaps I'll look into upgrading in a year or two.Definately my favorite gadget to date! 	sanarauf	11-01-2015 11:01:40	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

65337213	I'm done with this. I tried to upgrade from an 800 and this was my choice. Many reviews talk about the limited system memory but others rave about workarounds using an app manager and having all the memory they need.... not me. The preloaded Google apps won't move and constantly update eating up the limited system memory - while keeping the existing apps from working. The emergency app worked for the first couple of days - but despite storms and amber alerts since then - this phone tells me nothing. I'm ditching this phone for an 840 - oh, and losing all my time in the process - I have to give up any remaining minutes to move my number to the new non-android phone. And that triple minute thing... not so much with a droid from Tracfone. I want to send a text and see that 0.3 minutes was deducted when I hit the PREPAID button right there on my screen. With the droid, I've used one of my available texts - not 0.3 minutes. It wasn't all bad - the wifi worked well and kept me from using the data allowance - which was fortunate as I never found a Verizon signal to get on the net. I'm going back to what Tracfone with ATT does well - cheap talk and text. 	sanarauf	11-01-2015 11:27:38	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Upgrade	Applications	Software		true

Each time I was told the order was cancelled for additional credit information.

64438478	I got this phone as part of a rebate deal, trading in my trusty T-mobile service (and venerable black and white Motorola V66) for this shiny colour phone with Cingular's More bars in more places network.In both regards I've been disappointed.The Samsung x427m phone, first of all, does not come with an earpiece. This fairly inexpensive addition would have added tremendously to it's usefulness, and assuaged fears about radiation (see below).The phone has a tendency to interfere with speakers; I can only guess that it emits more radiation, such that it provides sufficient signal to drive the speakers. As it stands, it is aesthetically a minor annoyance to hear the speakers buzz occasionally when you bring it within 10 feet of a speaker, but the hidden health problems could be more serious. I am sure it is within the legal limits for radiofrequency emissions, but it still a little disconcerting nonetheless.You would think with increased emissions you would get better signal quality, but that is not the case here. Roughly 10% of my calls have to be redialed because for some reason or other the reception is so poor I can't make out what the other party is saying. Occasionally my voice gets so distorted over the phone that my friends cannot recognise my voice.The phone itself is not particularly user-friendly. It is not simple to save a number to the phone if someone dials using a new number to you. The number shows up, but there is no option to simply add the number to your phonebook. You need to retype it in to add it under an existing or new entry.The ringtones are either annoying or barely audible. I have missed quite a few calls because my phone was in a jeans pocket, and the material absorbed the sound. If you listen carefully though the music is quite nice.There are some good points about the phone. The games are quite neat; the chess is way too easy, but otherwise the games are quite playable. The battery lasts for quite a long time; it'll probably last 5 days with light use. The phone feels pretty solid and I've dropped it a few times without much consequence.Overall though this is a phone to give to your school-age kids. It won't make too much noise to disrupt classes, as you can muffle it with clothes, it doesn't have a camera so you won't worry about the issues associated with that. The interface is sufficiently cumbersome that you can enter the numbers permitted for dialing, and not worry too much about your child adding all of their friends. It looks nice enough that your kids won't look like they're carrying a brick or some obsolete product to school. It's light enough that it won't overload their schoolbag, and doesn't need to be plugged in every night so they can be a little lazy about maintenance. It's cheap enough that if you lose it, you can just get another one.Just teach them Morse code so that when you can't hear them you can still communicate by pressing the buttons. Oh, and pack a metal helmet to block the radiation. Then you're all set! 	sanarauf	11-01-2015 11:33:45	Complaint		Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		true
64463793	I will start with the positive aspects:Ample space compared to my old Sansung Galaxy Prevail. If you love to download and delete apps like I do, that is definitely a plus.I love the size of the screen. (Has been considered chunky to people with smaller hands.)That will conclude that section for now. Perhaps it's because I've become jaded that I can't think of many positive things to say about it.Here are the negative things I have got to say...Random shutting off/ Random freezing.Preinstalled apps that you have to pay money for to use. The office thing.Preinstalled programs I don't want to use. The ID thing.Text are sometimes recieved days later.Phone calls are of fuzzy quality when I call or recieve calls from out of state.Often when I recieve text messages or emails,my music will start up. Totally not cool if you listen to music with any kind of raunchy lyrics that you don't need other people to hear.My phone shut down completely. Was working 20 minutes earlier! I called the carrier, who referred me to the zte warrenty people. I contacted the warrenty people in China who were very hard to understand. Very thick accents, which is not bad exept for the fact that I can't conduct proper buisness unless I can understand what the other party is saying! What should have been a 5 minute conversation turned into 25 mins. The lady said that she would send me an email which mever came. I had to send them an email first two days later. They emailed me back with instructions. It's been four days and no response. I'm paying a bill that isn't even good for this month! Money down the drain for a crappy phone that just decided to cease function one day. No real help for the warrenty. I am really not happy to say the least.I would recommend buying a phone with better customer service. This is a real head ache and I have really no way of getting my buisness done other than my phone.Well I will say that it's kind of a cool phone.... It is like a child with emotional problems because it came from a family that doesn't care. 	sanarauf	11-01-2015 11:33:45	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Applications	Software		true

66046056	Buy this phone from Hasslefree Cell because that seller is awesome!!! I received everything in the box as descibed and it was a new unit. The Blackberry case was a sleeve rather than a magnetic pouch, but it's not a big issue. After seeing all the bad reviews under the Blackberry Bold 9650 seller web page i did my research and this was the only seller with an actual online website. That's a good clue to see whether a seller is legitimate. Great service and answered all my questions via e-mail. Thank you Hasslefree cell!!! Five stars all the way!!! 	sanarauf	11-01-2015 12:01:07	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

64338607	I bought this as a gift using the Virgin no contact plan.  The only negative I have is not with the phone but with the plan as web usuage is based on having a Wi-Fi connection which isn't always accessible. Plus the one I was giving this too does not have internest service at her home, so had to use a neighbor's password to connect to the Web.  Not real handy. 	sanarauf	11-01-2015 12:01:07	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
67015510	It doesn't have a camera or fancy ring tones. You can't buy more ringtones or graphics from Virgin Mobile for this phone. The phone numbers on the inside screen are displayed in tiny digits impossible to read in dim light. Its calculator is basic like something designed twenty years ago.Yet, I am delighted with this phone. Why?First of all, the cost of the phone is extremely low and even two dollars lower when I bought it from Virgin Mobile. Call quality is more than adequate while the speaker feature is loud and robust. Using the speaker, I can lay the phone on my lap while driving and have a hands free phone conversation.This phone even has a voice activation feature. I can press one button, say call home, and the phone dials home for me and any other number than's programmed into my contacts. For anyone who's not glued to his or her phone and likes to carry a just-in-case cell phone. This is the one. Right now I have the $20 dollar a month plan with 400 minutes. There's also a pay by the minute plan for those who rarely use the phone.Bottom line - I'm very pleased with this minimalist, inexpensive phone. 	sanarauf	11-01-2015 12:01:07	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
65361875	I wanted to get the phone unlocked for obvious reasons, but there are a few things I didn't know. For one, it doesn't come with US hardware, like the USB charger is a European model. There is no warranty either, I contact Amazon, they told me to contact where I got it, I think they said World Wide dist., they were short and terse with me. They couldn't tell me how I can register this phone. What's worse is that Samsung doesn't support it either - they made the phone. You can't ask questions because the number n7100 isn't a choice. So that's a big problem right there.I installed a Sandisk class 10 64gb micro sd card, it had the android on the cover. The phone knows it's there, yet there is no install to SD option anywhere on the phone, and most programs don't know from it. Some know it's there, some don't, some backup programs know it's there and can use it. But for the most part it's useless, and I can't find anyone in Samsung that will answer that simple question. I don't want to root the phone, because I don't want to take the chance messing it up. I'm hoping it's a glitch, 4.1.2 is rumored to come out at the end of January, maybe that will be fixed by then.That's why it's a 3.However that aside, it's a great phone. Fast, GPS locks on in seconds (though a little too often since it writes home to google each time you connect). Plenty of apps to get. I found it odd that even though I'm plugged into the USB, that the battery will drain. And the computer won't sync up with it, instead I have to rely on the wifi working.The pen feature is kind of dumb. Mostly it's the software, Samsung made the software and it doesn't flow like the system does. Like you can't drag and drop a file, you have to select by holding down, then move, then click the folder, then select move again, it's kind of tedious. The pen is also really hard to hold onto and that button is a joke, unless you have tiny hands.The size of the thing is rather large, and it's very slippery. Even with a case on it, it slid out of my pocket twice. If you plan on putting it in your pocket, and I place the glass side against my leg, choose a case that is sticky. When the otter box comes here and if it's less then retail I'll buy that. The instructions are terrible though it does come with a help app. The instructions that came with the phone was in 5 languages but not English, but you can download the full version online anyway, and the booklet was mostly for that pen.Everything about the phone is google oriented, and while I'm not totally certain, I think my search results for a map ended up in the google now that's installed. The talking features of the phone work well, they understand most things what I say, I just wish I could teach it my name. The spoken by it works well. The map functions is more than great because you can download 10 miles at a time, though the resolution drops the further away you get. But the maps are huge. But when offline you can browse these as if you were online and get spoken turn by turn instructions. If your online you can choose other routes to avoid traffic. There is a siri like thing on this device that I have yet to figure out. So far everything I asked has been totally ignored. Frankly I don't know what it's even for. I guess it's another gimmick to compete with apple.Graphics are fantastic, bold bright and pretty even. Strong contrast, you'll lose a little detail in the shadows, but everything else looks wonderful. There is a built in updater that will check and install any updates you programs might need. The info is in the notification box. The flash for the camera is a LED, pretty bright and can be used as a flashlight, so that's pretty neat. Oh you might want to get a better USB, I find that it's too short and seems to always pull out, along with that - you'll need the charger for your outlet, if you don't already have one. 	sanarauf	11-01-2015 12:01:07	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		true
66612403	The phone looks exactly like in the pictures, it is a standard candy bar phone by nokia with a screen that looks just average when compared to anything else that is out there. It is not as big or nice as the iPhone, and the screen looks below average when compared to the latest Evo.The worst thing about this phone is the OS, it uses the dated Symbian OS. It is slow, and has a very ugly interface. Also, there are not as many applications available as there are in Android or in the App Store.On the plus side, the phone has very good reception. I usually have better signal than my peers, even if we are on the same network and we are next to each other.Another bright point on the cell phone is the GPS Navigation App, I wouldn't say it is better than others, but it is free and it does not consume any data from you carrier. It is a very good GPS for your car and you do not need to pay any extras for it.So basically, if you have the money for an iPhone, get it, it is a much better cell phone. If you can get a good Android phone at the same price, I would prefer the Android phone, you have access to more apps and the interface is better and more responsive. I believe around or below the 200 price tag this cell is a good deal. 	sanarauf	11-01-2015 12:07:50	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

It's not a flashy phone for those looking for all the latest features, but it does have a IM capabilities, a couple standard games and decent ringtones.  My one complaint is that the phone drops calls easily when there is only one bar of service; I'd prefer if it just told you that there wasn't enough signal strength to make the call in the first place.  Overall though, the phone is well made and is of good quality and I recommend it to those looking for a basic entry level phone. 	sanarauf	11-01-2015 12:07:50	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		true

64435497	After I read this consumer alert, no way will I use Strait-Talk. Read and decide for yourself.Buyer BewareA good number of Straight Talk customers reported to Newsbeat Epicenter a variety of horror stories in conjunction with this cellular company. So Newsbeat Epicenter ordered the Samsung Glaxy Proclaim/Gingerbread 2.3 and the Samsung Galaxy Precedent Gingerbread 2.3 to experiment with. First of all the Android 2.3 is pretty amazing plus there are over 600,000 apps you may be interested in with many of them free of charge and others mighty low cost.However, unboxed, these Straight Talk handsets claim unlimited talk, text and data. As it turns out the talk and text have been unlimited with the Unlimited $45 load card. However, during our experiment our data slowed down to nearly nothing on both handsets in 3 week period of time. And when our techs called Straight Talk they claimed we used too much data so they drastically cut our speed way down. Straight Talk provided that the data is not at all unlimited as they claim. Well they refused to give us back our surfing speed and we were told we would not get back to normal until we renewsed our so-called Unlimited service the next month. So we did renew and our surfing speed went back to normal for a few hours then both handsets were deactivated because we used too much data. The one handset was reactivated yet we were warned about data abuse. The other handset was locked down entirely and we were told that phone could never be activated again by Straight Talk nor any other cellular company. By the way they charged us $53.08 yet deactivated our service about 12 hours later. We are seeking a chargeback of that money but have not received it as of yet. And we will not be receiving our money back for the expensive handset they locked down.So buyer beware! There is a catch to the Straight Talk unlimited data 	sanarauf	11-01-2015 17:14:43	Other	Other	No Defect	Other	No Defect	No Defect	not phone related	true

66367903	First of, there is LTE in the phone and if you go to tmonews dot com read about it.Second, why bother to sell it in the US? You mean you're annoyed because you are with the wrong cell carrier? I have T-Mobile for 30 bucks a month with 5 gigs of the HSPA+42 and unlimited the rest of the way at their standard speeds, plus UL text. Only 100 of voice, but past that's it's only a dime a minute. I rarely go over. Why people are paying 80- 100 dollars plus for a cell plan is beyond me.Third, Verizon's LTE is slower than the HSPA+42 in my city (and a bunch of others). I sat my phone next to my kids Verizon Iphone and my neighbors ATT Iphone5. It waxed the both of them.LTE is a term, that's it. So is 4g, with no speed standards for either.The standard to call a phone 4g is if it's faster than 3g. It could be only 10 percent faster, but that's all they need to gloss up that brochure. They are marketing terms to sell to some of the dim witted public. It's the speed that counts. When they pick up a sliver of speed of speed, wait for 5G and Super LTE + terms to rear their heads. It's all BS.A snippet of a review:In speed tests conducted by PC Magazine, T-Mobile's HSPA+ 42Mbps 4G network beat Verizon's 4G LTE network in 11 cities. What does PC Magazine think about T-Mobile's HSPA+ service? It's really fast, covers a lot of the country and is inexpensive, says the publication. Taking it even further, PC Magazine says that with this type of speed available to its customers, the nation's fourth largest carrier doesn't really need an  LTE network except to have the additional spectrum and for marketing purposes. Anyone who thinks that T-Mobile's HSPA+ 42Mbps network doesn't belong in the same conversation as LTE should probably take a look at the numbers 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 00:22:06	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

64100617	Any review of a smart phone must also consider other factors contribute to the smart phone user experience. These include:(1) the hardware...the phone itself(2) operating system software(3) installed applications(4) the network (overall, and where you happen to be using the phone at a particular time)(5) the service provider.These factors create serial dependencies, since many phones are tied to specific operating systems or service providers. Even if you make a great phone choice can be diminished by deficiencies in the service provider, the apps you choose and the state of the network where the phone is used most often.Make your move to your next (or first) smart phone only after researching these choices. Which provider? Which mobile operating system? Who offers the best service, or the best combination of value and service? The rest of this review assumes you've already figured out why a phone with the Android operating system might be a better choice for you than an iPhone, a Blackberry or a Windows-based smart phone solution.Every provider --including Sprint-- has a variety of pricing options. If you're a Sprint customer with two years on your current hardware and are ready to re-up: many phones are available at a deep discount (and Amazon's pricing for this model was better than Sprints by about ninety nine dollars...so comparison shop. For me, the difference between one cent and 99 dollars was a pretty easy decision point when it came from who to get the phone from).The HTC EVO LTE 4G phone is thinner and lighter (a full ounce lighter) than its EVO 4G predecessor. The user interface has changed slightly: three soft keys now populate the bottom of the display (down from four on the earlier model). The current Android Ice Cream Sandwich interface has slightly changed the method for placing/removing apps from the scrolling home pages. If you are new to smart phones, you'll have this learning curve, but even users upgrading from an earlier model/operating system version, can still expect to invest a few minutes in the relatively easy process of the new phone-human interface tricks to customize your home screens. Otherwise, most of the interface features will be familiar.This phone accommodates a microSD storage device (up to 32GB capacity). The install slot for this us under the top rear cover, which --unlike the EVO 4G-- does not have an obvious pry point for removing the cover. Work around the USB/charging port with a thin, flat tool and the cover will snap right off. The separate HDMI port present on the EVO 4G has left the 4G LTE, leaving this phone with just two ports: the USB/charging port (on the side) and a standard aux output. In addition to an on/off button (top), volume controls (right side), there is now a physical camera button on the lower right side of the phone.Video capture is in the .mp4 format, and was crisp and clear even in dim lighting. The 4G LTE has two cameras: one full 1080p HD, the other a front facing 1.3 MP camera. Still images..which can be captured even as the HD is recording are also crisp and clear. Audio output from the Beats software is as good as any I've heard being put out from a phone.In addition to the OS interface changes, the kickstand for this 'Droid has been repositioned more towards the center of the phone's back.So far the only issue that has emerged with this phone is an inability to fully run Amazon's own music app. Content on the phone plays fine, but my cloud-stored music never loads in the app's cloud tab. I would have also had the kickstand hinge from the opposite side, so that it could be used when a USB cable is plugged in.Finally, even though Sprint has an activation web site for phones you purchase outside of a Sprint store, if you are you will have to call a toll free number to complete activation if you have more than one phone on a shared data plan. While the call center's hours are long, they are NOT 24/7, so re-think activating the new phone as a project for a sleepless night:-) 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 00:22:06	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

65516516	This phone fits the bill for my needs.It is NOT a smartphone. I don't need a smart phone! I need a phone for talking and occasional texting, and this phone does both well. I would not recommend this phone for people who text all day, and have big fingers. The speaker is loud. The sound is great. The phone is light; I can barely feel it in my pocket. The touch screen works well enough. I bought this phone to use with PureTalk, and I wish I could remove all of the ATT apps that I do not need, but it is what it is and for the price I got it for, it can't be beat! 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 00:26:08	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

64380045	Simple and can't beat the price.  Only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that after the first couple of weeks, the battery charge  indicator went from 3 bars to 1 suddenly rather than gradually so you have to be alert about recharging it.  The one detail which should have been included in the instructions was how to key in names of contacts.  It is not intuitive (to me anyway) as you have to tap the T9 green ball to change it to #34;grey#34; to be able to tap in the letter you want--if the letter you want is the 2nd or 3rd in the square, you can then tap the square twice or 3x to get the letter you want.  I had to call for tech support to find this out. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 00:27:35	Neutral	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
64100586	Before addressing the hardware and functionality of this phone, some reminders about the major factors that will contribute to your smart phone user experience:(1) the hardware...the phone itself(2) operating system software(3) installed applications(4) the network (overall, and where you happen to be using the phone at a particular time)(5) the service provider.Serial dependencies come from these factors, as many phones are tied to specific operating systems or service providers.Just remember that even if you make a great phone choice, deficiencies in the other areas can still diminish your overall user experience.Make your move to your next (or first) smart phone only after researching these choices.

66789892	The battery on this phone dies so quickly. I charge it all day just to get 5 hours of battery life. The apps on the phone have a habit of getting stuck, so you have to restart, but they still may not work. The best features are the speakers which are very loud and clear, and the strong face glass. I gave this one to my daughter and bought an HTC. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 00:29:59	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	Upgrade	Operating System	Internal Hardware		true

52942848	This is the first phone that died on me in less than a year. All it took was 1 drop. The screen cracked in the bottom left area and now the entire touch screen doesn't work even though my phone had a cover. Google says talk to LG and LG said that I can send my phone for repair. When I asked them how much it will cost to replace the screen, I just got a response that it will be quite expensive and so it's probably not a good idea to send the phone for repair. This is the first time I had to call customer service for a phone and it was extremely unpleasant.My HTC Nexus One still works. For some reason as the number goes up, the quality goes down.I will never consider buying a Nexus phone if it's made by LG. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 00:29:59	Complaint		Hardware	Replacement	Hardware	Display		true

65470796	I ordered this phone 2 weeks ago and received it in only 5 days, contrary to the 2-3 week shipping estimate. The phone has a very solid feel to it, and there is nothing flimsy about it. The screen is HUGE; it dwarfs my iPod touch. It came with a usb charger, a cord, 2 batteries, a pre installed screen protector, a plastic back cover type case, and a cheap set of headphones with an inline mic. The battery life isn't bad if you make sure to manage the wifi, GPS, brightness, and bluetooth settings. Obviously if you leave them on all the time, battery life will be almost non-existent. This phone does support tethering, and it works well for me. I was able to use the phone's internet on my laptop with no problem. The maps are good, but the phone sometimes has trouble in buildings locating the GPS signal. The rear facing camera takes good to very good pictures, but sometimes has trouble focusing correctly. The front facing camera isn't great, but it's only used for skype anyway, so no complaints. The proximity sensor that shuts off the screen when you have the phone to your ear works fine for me; I had read somewhere that it would hang up when you touched the phone's end button against your cheek, but that hasn't been a problem. Also, this phone does have an accelerometer, aka gravity sensor, so games like bike race work well on this phone. This phone is really fast, too. I can stream music while playing games without a problem. The flash is about as bright as the flash on other smart phones and the touch screen is really sensitive. Ice Cream Sandwitch is nice, it works perfectly on this phone. The phone does act a little funny when it's charging on the included charger, but it works fine with other micro usb chargers, so no worries there. The main speaker is pretty loud for a phone, but the speaker used for phone calls could be louder. I activated this phone with Straigh Talk and had my old tracfone number ported to this phone in less than 2 hours. The stock keyboard leaves something to be desired, so I recommend that you just download Swiftkey 3, which costs about $4 after a free one month trial. In all, this phone is really great, especially when you consider that an unlocked Samsung Note costs around $500.UPDATEThis phone is still going strong after about 3 months. Sadly, after having it for only a couple weeks, I dropped the phone on its face and the camera stopped working. Since I'm not much of a picture taker and I didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning it, I figured I could live with it and kept going. A couple days ago I fell off of my longboard with the phone in my pocket and the screen cracked, as would any phone when the weight of a human sand witched it against concreted. This phone is so good I'm just gonna buy another one to replace my current one. Seriously, if I wasn't so rough on it it would still be functioning just as good as when I got it; it's not any slower than when I got it. Highly recommend. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 00:35:00	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
88464647	I got this new phone one week ago today from Verizon (not Amazon).  Unfortunately, had to return to Verizon store today to exchange phone.  There was a problem with the camera/software.  Other than that, I am very pleased with the phone.  I LOVE ICS!!  I upgraded from a Motorola Droid X, and am very impressed with the lightweight Spectrum II.-The touch screen is super responsive (sometimes just hovering over a letter while texting is enough).-Not too impressed with the face lock, I prefer not to look at myself every time I want to unlock the phone.-Many apps that are linked with your Google account will automatically load onto this phone (with ICS).-There are a lot of pre-loaded apps (56 total apps), many that I could live without, but most Amazon apps are pre-installed, with a wonderful widget included.  Amazon App Store is not pre-installed.-Smileys are difficult to use in many apps (if you can loacte them at all).-Predicitve text seems to be only available when texting.  Have not seen it in the browser.-I use Google Voice a lot  messages don't seem to be transmitted as fast as with my previous phone, arrive within minutes instead of seconds.-In the app drawer, preloaded apps are on first few pages, then apps you downloaded.  There is an option to arrange apps alphabetically, but will only arrange downloaded apps, not pre-installed. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 00:35:00	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	Replacement	Hardware	Camera		true
66102523	Samsung makes a great product.  This is my forth Samsung and I love it.If you need a smaller and lighter version of the S4 this is it.

64272104	Great little phone!  Very long battery life.  Easy touch buttons - it's a bid wider than my last phone, and this works out well for me as the buttons are bigger.

64342886	I had an unlocked Galaxy S4 ($800).  Everyone knows all the specs and features of that phone.  It took one fall, and it was done.I got this Galaxy Grand Duos ($350) as a replacement.  I didn't know what to expect, but so far, I'm pretty happy with it.GOOD:-I didn't use all of the S-features on the S4, but I'm happy MOST of them are on the Grand Duos (I can't seem to get all of them to work, but on the same note, I couldn't get them to work on the S4 either.  I use 2 screen mode a lot, and I'm happy it's on the Grand Duos)-specs say that the screen resolution is not as good as the S4, but I honestly can't tell the difference-the interface is much like S4 and Note, so it's very easy to use and to get help with (ie screen shots, 2 screens, awake with voice are the same process/commands on all Galaxies).-call quality is clear and consistent.-it's bigger than the S4 and smaller than the Note (which is perfect for me!)-battery life is actually better than it was on the S4 for me (possibly bc of the lower screen resolution)-it looks great, and I'm in the #34;Galaxy#34; club, without any contract/subsidies, and for a fraction of the price of the Note and S4.  While I can tell it from the S4 and Note very easily, other people can't (except a Samsung representative noticed every difference instantly)-it has things the Note and S4 don't have (dual sim for avid travelers, FM radio, minimal bloatware with just the essentials and a few Samsung apps)-it looks expensive enough that I'm proud to have it out, but it's secretly cheap enough that it's still replaceable if lost/stolen/broken on a tripBAD:-the camera is not as good.  It takes decent shots, but with 8 MP (vs the 16MP on the S4), you notice that you are missing some detail, especially when you zoom.  If the focal point is distant and detailed, it comes out a little muddled. Good quality up close and without zoom,  Also, if it has all the nifty camera features like the Note and S4, I haven't found them yet.  So far, it just seems to be run-of-the-mill camera options-if the Grand Duos has 4G, I can't seem to find it-I don't think it has scroll with eyes or look away pause, but you can scroll with tilt and turn over to pause (I haven't used them yet, but they're there in the settings menu.  On a positive note, a lot of those extra features on the S4 and Note are battery drainers anyway)-fewer awesome accessories available (like docks, magnetic covers, etc)-it comes with a European plug (my seller tossed in an adapter, and I already had a few anyway.  I'm definitely planning on ordering an American OEM Samsung charger)-the speaker is perfect for making calls;  even on a mount in the car, there is no trouble communicating with the mic and speaker.  However, when I play music, it's a little quieter that I remember the S4 being.-Less internal storage space than the S4, the Grand Duos has 4GB internal (I read there would be 8GB, but my phone says 3.94GB internal space).  I have a ton of apps (all internal for now), and a few songs and pics (most of my media is on my SD and all of it is backed up to cloud).Other things to note:-I thought the earphones jack didn't work, but you really have to push it deep in there until you hear a click.-both SIM slots are for the standard (large) SIM cards.  I used my same mini SIM card from my S4, but taped it in to a SIM adapter ($1 on Amazon, $5 at T-mobile store if you can't wait for shipping).  I didn't have it taped, and my phone stopped working one night.  The next day, I took it to T-mobile, and she just taped the top.  I haven't had any issues since)Do I recommend this product?  --All the time!Am I happy with this purchase  --Absolutely!Will I get it again?  --If I lose this one and the next generation isn't here, then of course I will get this same phone again.  Ideally, I would like to keep this phone as my international phone for trips, and get the S5 for the US when it comes out (if the camera is better than the Nokia Lumia 1020) 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 00:35:00	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

47807784	I like this phone. Great screen, fast, cool design. I'd really want to keep it. However, there's one thing that absolutely kills me! The highly praised Beats Audio on this device (as on other HTC phones) makes it impossible to listen to your music or online radio, or pretty much anything through an external audio system, like in your car, or on your hi-fi system. If you are connecting it through the headphone phone jack. I tried everything. My car, my computer speakers, my Sony sounds system at home. It sounds extremely distorted! So, be aware, that you can listen to music on this device through headphones only. I'm really disappointed and just don't get WHY they had to incorporate such a stupid feature. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 09:16:39	Neutral	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Ports		true

66523597	This phone has fallen out of teeny tiny hand purse repeatedly! from a bike! onto a street! It keeps functioning! It does seem to be made of some cheap budget feel plastic, but, whatever works, right? what do you expect? you get what you pay for. The display screen seems much more large than my old phone. (this may be important to you, if you like internet). I do not have a lot of experience with the internet, but it was not slow! The texting of photos was so incredibly slow, it was just archaic! It seemed to take one or two minutes to text pics?! I live in the city, so, I dont' understand this issue. The SAR rating is very very low 0.29 compared to Apple and other popular phones at 1.2. Perhaps, this affects the speed? I don't really know,but I am curious! One complaint, is when I want to check the time, I either must flip open the phone, or push and HOLD the outer buttons for one to two seconds. Personally, I find that somewhat annoying. The most annoying feature is the fact that my very old ancient Verizon phone (from Verizon website) would hold over 500 photos in the memory! My Samsung Gusto does not have much memory at all. It only seems to hold about 70 photos? I called Verizon about this issue. I said is my phone defective? it only holds 70 photos? why is that? the only answer they seemed to come up with is that you can take your phone to any big box store and print photos? Verizon is grandfathering out the old Pix place website where you could DL to your computer. (It would cost .25 per upload. I miss this feature. but I don't think anyone else was even aware of this..... or $1 per day to upload photos directly to web). Oh. And you can DL apps and stuff (of course!). it even comes with a creepy FREE APP of daily celebrity news???! (Verizon did help  me to delete this, but it puts an error message on my phone when I open it once per day. how odd.)  I find the FREE APP to be very creepy. Verizon wants to know what I am interested in reading News? or it wants to entice me to click to learn more and use internet time and $ perhaps? OH! And I've only used this phone about once to talk. I did not experience any issues with clarity. It seemed plenty loud enough. I don't hear it much on vibrate, but I assume that's my fault. I have never really recieved any calls with the ringer on, so I don't know how loud it is. I live in the city. Sometimes, I walk to University on busy streets.I should test this feature for you. but the phone is only for emergencies. to call AAA or My dad for repairing a flat tire (instead of 911). OK. Thank you for your time. I hope this review helps! OH! and I keep trying to touch the screen when the internet is on, to click to the next link. That's Hilarous! This is not a touch screen! ha ha!PS. My phone initial activation from Verizon for 2 months for the price of one!!!! Plus, the first activation minutes were actually INCLUDED in the purchase price of the phone!!!! Wow! Can you believe this?! I don't know if that deal is advertised for this particular internet offer. it may be outdated! 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 09:16:39	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

64796591	I love this phone, but it's seriously trouble prone.  And Nokia has turned it's back on Symbian.This review is actually for TWO N8's, one is the phone I purchased new, the other is a phone my sister purchased new.  Both phones have had many issues, but all turned up after the one year warranty expired.First let me say that I don't 'overwork' the phone, I've not downloaded any apps (ovi store is limited anyhow), or modified the OS in any way. Both phones are fully updated running Belle.  Doing full factory resets have not cleared up any of the below problems, and no, it's not a setting somewhere.List of problems:My phone-1.  Drops cell tower connection randomly, and never comes back on it's own, I have to restart. (won't recieve or make calls)2.  Screen will not light up while outdoors (sunlight) upon incoming call, which makes it impossible to answer call.3.  Cannot install the maps update, because phone is out of memory, 16 gigs of memory should be more than enough.Sisters old phone - (which I've been using)1.  Asks for a security code on start up (i just enter 1, it says fail, but unlocks anyway)2.  Battery life is horrible.  Still terrible with new battery (unplug at 7AM, completely dead by 4pm with no use at all, standby only) the other N8 will work about 1.5 days of moderate use before needing a recharge.3.  Update icon won't go away.  Even after checking for new updates (and it confirming it's fully updated) it still shows up.The phone is great when it works correctly, but considering that Nokia is shooting 0 for 2 on N8's, there will be no more Nokia's for Us.  My sister has moved on to a work provided Blackberry, and I'll probably make the move to Android.  At least there is support for them.  I've had Nokia's since the late 90's, but this one is the last one I'm going to throw my money away on. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 09:30:15	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Upgrade	Operating System	Software		true

65432615	I got this phone a couple days ago and I am very impressed it has some pros and cons. I never used a regular v3 so I can't really compare it to that. I don't understand what one of the reviews was talking about saying the phone book is hard all you have to do is start search then you can type in the first letter of the name you want to get to and it'll take you to the names in your phone book that start with that letter, but thats neither here nor there.Some things you want to consider before you order this unlocked non North American version of this phone. Not all V3i's come with itunes, only Australia, NZ, Indonesia, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Turkey, South Africa, Rest of Africa, North Africa, Israel, Thailand, and finally Middle East versions of the V3i come with itunes. Is the one amazon is selling from one of those markets I don't know, I got mine off ebay. But even if it doesn't come with itunes you can still listen to mp3s off of it within the motorola mp3 player software which I think is called Digital Audio Player or DAP for short.Alright the phone feels and looks great, and the camera quality is damn good considering the size of this phone and the fact that is indeed a PHONE with a CAMERA and not a CAMERA with a PHONE. Here is a link to a picture I took with the camera at work. [...] . This phone is semi customizable like being able to change your wallpaper and having your own mp3 ringtones, via a usb cable. Like I said my version came with cable, data software, itunes and stereo head phones I don't know what this version comes with. Next I'll list pros and cons.PROS:Small sizeLooks GreatGood reception and sound qualityCustomizable featuresMp3 player capabilitiesTakes fine photos and videoIn my opinion easy to use and straight forward navigationSpeaker phone is loud and clearCONS:iTunes seems to limit the number of songs you can have depending on what size transflash you have. For example with my 256 card it only lets me have 50 songs and on a 512 card it'll only let you have 100 songs.A delicate phone, I use extra caution handling this phoneFront screen resolution could be better, but gets the job doneIncluded java games suckIn closing I think this phone is well suited for me, by being slim, customizable and having mp3 playback. Even if it does cap me at 100 songs my walk to and from work is quite a short distance anyway this way I can just keep the ipod plugged in the car and just use my phone for music. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 09:37:34	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

64857431	Although you may think #34;It is a cheap phone#34; IMHO it works very very nice:  It could be compared to mid-up level phones such as Samsung Ace, LG 3  5 Huawei, etc. It comes with Android 4.2 just you take it outside the box (which  is a plus); nice main camera (and it does have a secondary one for video call services); memory slot, removable battery -a little to weak for a day of medium-hard use.- you barely arrive and the end of a 8/10 hours' day- but again: the battery is removable; so, you may buy a second one if you wish.It uses dual sim card (but only one gets 3G capabilities) so check you operator' 3G band. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 09:37:34	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

66298090	I have had this phone for about a month now, and i can say it was a huge disappointment! I bought this phone through Dell and only paid about $270.00, so at the time i thought i was getting a really sweet deal,I should have taken the youtube reviews more serious...I will start with some of the good things first.The design is very nice and professional, things are kinda compact in size, but for what it attempts to do, is built into a very slim package. the phone also feels very high quality and lite.phone calls and speaker were always superb.The camera is neat! it takes very nice pictures, records video, and can even do panoramic pics.The battery life is extremely good for a smart phone.here is where things come crashing down...first, there is no off button, serious. you can turn off the screen, turn off wifi, BT, but you can NOT shut off the phone without taking out the battery, so if some app gets stuck or you need to reset to your network, you will have to take the thing apart to accomplish this. dont believe me? google PALM's answer for not including an off button.second, the wifi support is lousy, I would establish a link to my home wifi and my work wifi connections, only to have to reset them every other week because the phone would forget to use them as default.the media player on it sucks! it will play video, mp3. BUT, i found that trying to listen to music on it, tracks would constantly stutter. and forget about using the stereo bluetooth. I had a really difficult time trying to figure out if the stuttering was caused by the headset or the phone only to discover, for some reason, if you shut off the screen while media player is going, tracks will start stuttering, which basically meant, i had to leave it pluggged in with the screen on to listen to music...the final issue i had, was with email. I would go through the process of setting up a pop email account ('gmail', 'work'). things would look good for a couple of days, or even a week, and then all of a sudden I would get error messages indicating 'sent messages could not be sent' or something similar. the email accounts would completely stop working, and the only way to alleviate the issue i could come across was to delete the accounts on the phone and go through the whole process of setting up the accounts all over again.i'm pretty sure a lot of these issues are caused by the fact that it uses 'win mobile'. that seems to be the popular answer. but i would have liked things to have been tested and worked right out of the box. and not have to be a network admin to set up basic wifi... 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 09:48:44	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Enclosure		true

66119116	My niece has a good working Net10 phone that I buy minutes for all the time, so I thought I'd pick one up for my husband and I.  Here's my horror story.I picked up this model in Walmart on a Thursday.  I had to bring it back the following day because the back cover that was included in the clamshell case was THE WRONG ONE, and WOULDN'T FIT.  The girls behind the counter had a little laugh as they opened up 3 more of the same model cases until they found a back cover that would fit it, and I went back home with it a second time.I plugged it in that afternoon, hoping for a powerup by sometime that evening, but nothing.  The following morning, Saturday, still nothing.Completely disgusted, I returned to Walmart that same day and just returned it.If this is any indication of the quality of present Net10 phones, I'm having nothing to do with it, and am, unfortunately very gun-shy about any of them from any manufacturer at the present time. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 09:55:26	Complaint	Unable to Use	Hardware	Other	Hardware	Enclosure	return	true

(K790i INTERNATIONAL and K790c CHINA MAINLAND 900/1800/1900 MHz). I had to purchase walkman in-earphones to get the best multimedia experience. Amazing battery life and brilliant photos for this 3.2MP Cybershot. (Note, its little longer than K750i but its fun too). Its well build and even the rumored joystick problem never occured for me.

I initially had some concerns about how boring and square-ish it looked, but having owned it for almost 2 weeks now, I actually think this phone has the nicest form when compared to the Lumia 820 and Lumia 822.Good things (about the Phone):1) Doesn't feel cheap, feels very solid and premium in your hand. And probably the thing that endears me to this phone the most.2) Way faster than my old WP7 phone.3) Hardware buttons positioning are highly accessible and logical.4) Removable and exchangeable cover (but I have yet to see any information about where the Cyan color cover can be bought)5) MicroSDHC card support - expandable storage6) Large battery = very good battery life7) Very clear and sharp display8) Large screen, but still comfortable to hold in the hand and fits easily into your pocket.9) Nokia exclusive apps10) Rather significantly cheaper than the HTX 8X, yet still very much an outstanding and top-notched phone despite the lower price point.Negatives:1) Night shots (or shots in areas with dim lights) with this phone produces rather disappointing pictures.

63705513	I have had this phone for a week and I love it!  Before this phone, I had the LG Spectrum.  Not one problem with it over the 20 months I used it.  Before that, I had the LG Env 2  3 phones and never a problem with them.  I agree with some of the people on here that state that their reception with this phone is better than many of the other phones.  The main thing to do with any smart phone is to set it up properly.  There are a few things you can do to make your battery last longer.  With the Spectrum 2, I have more than half of my battery left at the end of the work day after using it to do many different things like FB, e-mail, text messaging and phone calls.  Instead of drinking the Kool-aid of Samsung, where their phones are way over hyped and less quality, do the research on each phone.  I did that and found that this phone is one of the best out there!  I talked to Verizon techs before I bought this phone and they stated that the Motorola phones had the most problems, followed by the Samsung.  I am a very picky person!  Everything I own is of very high quality, and the Spectrum 2 is no exception!  In my opinion, a great phone!An update: I got rid of the LG Spectrum 2 less than two weeks after getting it. Developed many problems. When getting into my email, a pop up would appear that said Network unavailable, please try again later. I would back out once and then go back in and sometimes it would be fine. Another problem was the charging port became loose so that when I put the charging cable in, it would move around. There was other things that went on and my daughter's Spectrum 2 did it too. We both have the LG G2 now and love them! Not one problem!

1674487	This phone is awful. Number one if you're expecting a galaxy s3 or anything even close look again. I bought this knowing its a knockoff and not expecting much and I'm still horribly disappointed. It looks nothing like the pictures and is significantly smaller than the galaxy s3. It is not even an android system, it is set up exactly like the flip phones I used in eighth grade like 6 years ago. You cannot download apps, get on the internet without trying to throw the phone, or customize or change much at all. The camera is awful but that is actually on here and I knew it would be bad before I got it. The phone barely stays on I find myself having to turn it back on after it randomly turns off at all day. One good thing I can say is that the battery lasts FOREVER, but that's because I LITERALLY CANNOT RUN ANYTHING- facebook, internet, email.... nothing. There are better knockoff phones I know that for sure. This is a GIANT waste of money no matter what carrier you are using. Also, I am using this for straight talk and still haven't gotten the internet set up because the APN settings are just ridiculous and nothing how they should be. So I would definitely reccommend NEVER getting this. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 10:05:01	Complaint	Unable to Use	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		true

65904035	I was looking for an unlocked phone for overseas travel (via locally purchased SIM card) and the Nokia C6-01 fit the bill.  Good value and compact, the C6-01 provides a GPS, web browser, phone, text, WiFi and mail...all work well, in the USA or abroad.  Although Nokia provides an app library, if you're a power iPhone app user, this phone is not for you.  Vendor delivered what was ordered and when they promised. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 13:38:55	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
66706141	Phone is smaller than I had expected,  with the intention of attracting the visually impared, (Audio keys when dialing), the keys  screen are too small to see,  use. Redialing is also tedious for some unknown reason, taking 4 presses of the green call key to complete. Also found a problem with the address book, with same name, different number, isn't easy to pull up on the screen.If your elderly family needs a user friendly phone, this isn't it. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 13:38:55	Complaint	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
64967603	Hey I think mercedes are nice looking, feel good to drive but it seems that once you own one for any length of time the flaws start to show. The nexus 4 is alot like this.I bought two of these phones an 8 gb and 16 gb version.  As soon as I made my first call the problems arised.  There was static/buzzing in the earpiece.  So I go online and find out (despite the amount of five star reviews) that this is a common problem.  It seems like you can hear the processor even when not on a call.  I tell my self fine, it isn't the end of the world it is not too loud.Then the bluetooth problem came.  Granted mine wasn't as bad as alot of others but I always had difficulty syncing my phone with my car.  I would have to enable/disable bluetooth, re-pair etc.  Bluetooth in my car is important so I decide to use my free upgrade and get a galaxy s4 (I was originally going to sell whatever upgrade I got basically making the google phones free).  In all honesty the galaxy S4 didn't pair always that great either (come to find out my bluetooth is glitchy, car has now been replaced), but also online people complained about the nexus 4 and bluetooth.At this point I'm kicking myself in the butt thinking maybe I jumped the gun when it could have been my car the whole time.  Then it happened...My wifes phone would die with 27% battery remaining and the time would not update.  We had to reset the phone to get it to work.  Needless to say she also got a galaxy (S3).Outside of those problems listed above we liked the phones because it was easy to use as our first android phones and had a bunch of useful features (was less complicated then the galaxy), and was a no contract phone, so we didn't have the bloat ware on it.  It doesn't matter how great a phone is if it isn't realiable.  I just urge prospective buyers to research fully (not just read reviews here) before buying the phone. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 13:49:07	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Upgrade	Operating System	Software		true

If you want to keep your wallpaper clean, you need to drag bag the shortcut again into the slider.And of all, I can't give you a detailed review since my touch dead with in 2 weeks, I googled for more info, and found that there are lots of complaints about the same.If you want to buy this phone, please don't throw away yours old phone, you are going to need it soon. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 14:04:46	Complaint	Unable to Use	Both	Upgrade	Operating System	Display		true
64588488	I fell in love with this phone for a few reasons... 1: the size! I love how big the screen is. Great for watching videos, browsing the web, playing games, etc... 2: great service. Rarely am I having to search for bars with this phone. 3: storage. Has a tremendous amount of space for apps! Overall this phone performs just as well as some of your more popular brands. My only critique about this particular model, is the camera. Not gonna lie, could've been better! 5mp regular facing camera, with a 0.3mp front facing cam. Kind of disappointing. Higher quality cameras would've made this blu studio a 5 star phone for sure. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 14:04:46	Complaint	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	camera (AOI)	true

64443944	I really like the phone for its price.  However, it is my first smart phone, so I am bound to like it no matter what.  Everything in the other reviews is true. It is small, which I like; the gps doesn't work, though I did make get my location with some apps like gps injector.  The battery life is longer than a couple days. The speaker and notifications are on the quiet-side. Best of all it runs Torque well.Most disappointing is that Airvoice Wireless cannot help me set up data because the phone isn't in its data base.  Other providers may have the issue, or not.  Would SVP please help me? Or AirVoice?  What's the problem?  This phone and Airvoice's $10 plan is a winning combo.  I should be happy, but I want full functionality--am I asking too much, even if I won't use much data?Bottom line:  the phone is just fine for gsm calling and text on Airvoice's ATT network with wifi access for data.To follow up, with a little internet research in the next day, I found the settings to make data work on my own.  Anyone can do it.  So, I'll give the phone another star. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 14:04:46	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

68465788	I ordered this phone after reading so many positive reviews about it, and I was so happy when I received it and opened the box. The phone itself is sleek and very beautiful. The screen is bright, the processor is very fast, and number of free apps is unbelievable. But my excitement was cut short after the first day of usage. I fully charged the phone, went to work and showed all my co-workers my new beautiful phone and how good it was. However, by the end of the day, the battery was dead. All I did with the phone was made a few calls and that was it and played very few games. I thought maybe I had down loaded too many apps, so I deleted about 25% of them, I deemed the screen, turn off wifi when not in use, put the phone to sleep in 2 minutes when not in use. I down loaded battery monitor and checked and deleted what was consuming too much battery. It got just a little better but the battery still drains like crazy. I have returned to the use my iphone 4 and nexus 4 is now just sitting on my night stand. What a shame! Google could have done better with this phone battery life.  Other than the battery, the phone is excellent. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 14:15:40	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	Replacement	Hardware	Internal Hardware		true
42655265	My husband and I both have the HTC Windows 8x phones. We've had this phone for less than a year and about 5-6 times a day, we both get a SIM card error and a message saying that wecan only make emergency calls. Also a separate issue where the phone turns itself off has started to appear about 4-5 times a day. There are no warnings when these things happen, we just notice that our phones have not gotten any emails or texts in several hours and then realize that is because it's been off for hours. This is happening with both of our phones and when I went to the Verizon store, they told me that they were both known issues with this phone. I don't recommend this model at all. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 14:15:40	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		true

65304009	Given 1 star for the easy access to songs/artist/albums/shuffle, and another for decent battery life and the mini usb/usb charging capabilities.It's all down hill from there.I must warn all of you, the phone I bought from hasselfree(or whatever they changed their name to) came shipped to me as a Russian phone.  Russian text on the keys(just looks lame).  I feel like a complete idiot for buying this phone.  However, I was desperite and needed one fast and thought, why not for 100 bucks.  This might not bother some, but the listed images reflecting the item purchased is not correct.Firmware updates are not available from Motorola.  T-Mobile updates are not available.  You'll have to do some research in order to find the correct settings for your phone.  Took me about a week.  My previous phones were all synched seemlessly intergrated.This phone also has TONS of lag when browsing through menus.  Doesn't matter what type, but I have found that, bluetooth will only add to the delay.The other thing I was gonna add is fact that the phone is in RUSSIAN.What's really weird about this phone is the speakerphone.  While playing music, it's great(for a phone) but during a phone call, it's average.  The speakerphone volume changes, why?  I dunno.  But it does, and it disapointed me as soon as I tried using it for a phone call.  Couldn't find any setting to try and tweak it.Bluetooth connections with headset pieces are sad compared to my last two phones, z6 and samsung.  Lots of digital static as if the phone was 20' or 30' away even though the ear piece and phone are less than 4' away from each other(cell in pocket/bluetooth headset in ear).I've used this phone for a more than 4 months and haven't had too many problems.  The cell phone's reception compared to the two previous phones is a 7/10.  I used to get a solid reception in my bedroom, now I have to go outside and stand infront of a planter in order to NOT drop a call.Though the expandable memory and internal memory sound like a plus.  The phone's internal system just added to the lag.  I kept everything on the SD card.  Thought this phone should have been called the lag.  Even with a brebone system with 1 mp3 on it, the phone still lags.  Really sad because this phone really looks cool!9/19/09I just added the data plan, omg... one thing to say... NEVER BUY A RANDOM UNLOCKED PHONE ever ever ever... Saving a few bucks just isn't worth the headache... buy the real thing.  Hasslefree or whatever they call themselves now asked why in an automated email... what can we do to help you?  full well knowing the crap they were selling.  This phone is just 100% pure jacked up.  EVERYTHING needs to be reset to a factory default that isnt available ANYWHERE!  You're going to be the one researching/plugging in everything... on your own.In all, screw this phone.  It looks awesome!  but yeah... most guys/girls that I know don't twitter their junk to a outdated cell phone.At most, this phone is worth 40 bucks... 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 14:50:54	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Software		true

I don't get a lot of my texts. this is the second ally i've had, it constantly says i have no space yet, I go through and wipe everything and it will go away for a while then come back. Also, it hates every SD card i've put in it. I can not use it and the battery will die in 3 hours. When it works, it is a pretty cool phone. But the thing is it hardly ever works. also, the touch screen goes unresponsive for hours and then goes nuts. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 14:57:18	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Display		true

64218085	I was on vacation for a month when this phone was pre-ordered and have only used it since mid-January.  Working  living in the middle east is a drag when it comes to using electronics to their optimum potential.  Yet, this is the best smartphone, phone, whatever.....I have had in the 8 years I've lived outside the U.S.  The nokia description, of this device being a small computer first, phone 2nd is spot on.  If you failed to read a statement similar to that, you may be disappointed in your first week of use.  My best friend has this phone and can't stand it.  Mainly because he can't navigate through it.  If you're a person who thinks black  white then you won't like this phone.  For people who can see grey, you'll be most satisfied.  I have had smartphones before.  The N95 which I lost and I currently have the N96.  I personally think the N95 is better than the 96.  However this review isn't for either one of those phones so let's talk about the real deal.  The N900, I don't know how much potential it has but I will be sticking with it to find out.  I took about a week to just navigate through this phone.  Yeah, a week to see what I could and couldn't do.  Camera is OK I suppose.  I honestly don't care about how great the camera is on any phone.  The pictures I've taken are pretty clear.  You can multi-task with this device which is great.  You want to reply to text messages while surfing the net, answer a call all within seconds then this phone is a keeper.  I wasn't familiar with the OS beforehand but I'm more than impressed.  The phone runs smooth.  You buy a $500 phone, you want it to run smoothly.  Remember, this is a small computer before it's an actual phone.  For anyone who can't understand that, stay away from this phone, stick with your iphone.  This phone doesn't have 2 thousand apps, not yet at least.  I didn't get my phone to play games on though.  I have an xbox  ps3 when I need my gaming fix.  I have a few friends with iphones and all I see them doing is playing games on it anyway.  That's great and all but actually trying to compare these 2 phones is like comparing apples  oranges.  If you want to just play games, make calls, and load your phone with apps, then this isn't the phone for you.  However if you want to have vast flexibility in the palms of your hands then you will do fine with this device.PROS:  Multi-tasks like no other.  Exterior construction is more durable than most other phones in my opinion.  Used without a hard cover for a good 2 weeks and doesn't have any scratches.  With all the things that you're able to do with this phone, it hasn't frozen up once.  An internet page fails to open every now  then but that happens with my MAC.  You can customize your 4 desktops with different photos or a main theme if you're into that.  Customize each desktop with the things you use the most, call directory, phonebook, google, media player, whatever.  Downloads other software/programs with ease.  Physical keyboard is more efficient than the virtual keyboard in my opinion.CONS:  I would love something as little as portrait mode to be used with more features other than the phone set-up.  Couldn't find a speed dial feature, maybe I'm retarded.  Receiving a call can be annoying when it keeps flip flopping between landscape  portrait mode.  An update would be greatly appreciated NOKIA. Phone is thick sure, heavy.....not so much.  Maybe heavy for 120lb weaklings.  You want a thin cute phone, get a motorola of some kind.  Battery life could be better just because it would be convenient.  If you're constantly using your WI-FI and bluetooth then battery life will be an even larger problem for you.  However, battery life is a constant problem for most smartphone users anyway from what I read.Hope this review helps anyone looking to buy a smartphone. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 15:23:48	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

22349581	This phone has surprised me.  I have owned lots of Android phones and this one might be my favorite yet.  I NEVER thought I would say this about an LG phone.  To put it in perspective, I have owned the Galaxy Nexus, S3, Rezound, Razr and Razr M.The one area where this phone really shines is reception.  The Galaxy Nexus literally could not pick up a signal at my house, the S3 was not much better and the Motorolas had a solid 3G signal but barely picked up a 4G signal.  This phone has been on a 4G signal over 90% of the time.  Calls are crystal clear too.  Not sure why the LG has a stronger signal at my house than any of the other phones but it does.The IPS HD screen is awesome too.  Much better screen than some of the more expensive phones...It comes with some delivered themes.  The Thor one is especially cool.It runs fast too.  It had some delays when I first started using it but that has cleared up.  I deactivated quite a few of the delivered apps that I do not need.The GPS locks on fairly quickly but not as fast as the Razr M did.The battery life is average but good enough for me.  I am constantly around a charger if needed.  If you need great battery life and do not have access to a charger regularly, this might not be the phone for you.  On the positive side, the battery is user replaceable if needed.  There might be after market options for a different battery but I have not seen one yet.  It also comes with a micro sd card slot for expansion.  So many phones these days do not have either of these options.The overlay that LG uses does not bother me.  You could always use a launcher if needed.The phone would be even better with Jelly Bean.  Hopefully this will happen sooner than later but I doubt it since the sales of this phone will be small and not likely a priority for Verizon.  Plus LG has not been known for quick updates in the past.In my mind, LG has come a long way since even last year.  If you want a great HD screen and excellent reception on a budget, this phone is a great option. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 15:42:37	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

64885610	This phone is amazing. The design, the screen, the camera. And also the feel of it. It was amazing. The reason I am giving 3 stars rather then 5 ids because one day I was using the video camera and the phone just froze. By the way this phone had no problems before. Well after it froze, I tried everything. Soft reset, hard reset and even took out the battery and charged it, but the phone does not turns on at all. And I mean nothing happens. So I called Samsung and guess what they said. The person who works there told me that the Samsung company in the U.S.A. does not fix international phones and that if I want it fixed I would have to call the company in China. So I decided to take it to a repair shop and they said the same thing. So yeah, great phone and all as long as it works. Once it stops working, its difficult to get it fixed. My advice buy the Galaxy S2, just not the international version. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 16:57:50	Complaint	Unable to Use	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Internal Hardware		true

83454710	I have had this phone for around 6-8 months and cannot wait to get a different one. It operates pretty well most of the time (mainly the times when your not in need of its features) The signal is very finicky and often will jump from 4G to analog in the same location (this leads to many voice mails that pop up without a call first not to mention the missed called that don't leave VM). When sending text messages it often takes a very long time to send out and occasionally will take hours to send a message without me realizing. The NFC feature (one of the reasons I choose the Spectrum II) is horrible and compleatly dysfunctional and continuously needs reprogrammed defeating the purpose of the feature in the first place. DON'T BUY THIS PHONE with all the options out there you can certainly find something more reliable and functional. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 16:57:50	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		true

I carefully checked the bands before purchase, with T-mobile, but the phone I received could not connect to their data network at greater than #34;edge#34; network, even though this is billed as a 4g/LTE phone.  On returning the phone, getting my money back took a month, and came as a partial refund, so that on my tight budget I can't buy a version of the phone that will work on T-mobile.

66161713	A whole new series of 3 megapixel phones are coming out now, so I can't say how this one compares to the others.  There is a new Samsung out that is about a half the size, but I don't know about the photoquality.  There are many factors that go into the quality of a photo, not just the megapixel count.  Other than the size and a few other things, I'm very satisfied with this phone/camera.  My overall goal was to be able to go out and about with only one electronics thing.  I dont want to carry my ipod, pda, camera, and phone everywhere.  This phone suffiently fulfills temporary and short-term outings.Here are the pros and cons.PROS:-Great screen, in terms of size and color-The phone/address book is very expandable, and can include unlimited phone numbers, addresses, and notes for each contact.  You can enter their address, birthday, whatever you want.  It syncs with Outlook, but I find that I only call regularly from my mobile phone a small portion of the people  from my outlook contacts.-Photos are very nice.  They are a bit smaller in file size than my old Sony 3.2 MP cybershot camera, but on the whole there is not much noticeable difference.  The daylight photos are great.  Low-light photos are very good for scenary, such as inside European churches, city streets, etc.  There is a very good image stabilizer, so the low-light photos are very good considering that my hands shake a lot.  Indoor people photos, however, are so-so.  This is true with any digital camera as a general rule.  But I've had problems with focusing (common) and sometimes i want to use the flash in the daytime (bright background, but person in shadow) and it doesnt always let me.  Still, it's convenient.-Great speaker sound, for music or speaker phone-Radio.  Nice add-on you don't get on a lot of the other 3.2 mp phones.-Good music playing.  Though you can't use your own headphones, you have to use the Sony ones that double as the hands-free microphone/headphones, the sound is very good.-You can copy and paste onto the memory card or phone any image photos and put them on your phone to show to people or for your own enjoyment.-Good battery life, if you don't have the screen lit up all the time.-I haven't used the 3G aspect of it, as this is expensive.  But the capability is nice.  Haven't tried out the internet either.-Despite the large size, it feels very comfortable to use.  It holds well in the hand, and the number pad keys are soft, though a bit close together.-Dedicated music play/pause button.-Good flash, with multiple flashes for red-eye reduction.-Nice leather hand strap.CONS:-Sending SMS to more than one person is a pain.  You have to go through several menus to select each person, one at a time.-Sony memory stick micro.  Yet another expensive sony memory card format.  MicroSD is the same size, and much cheaper.-Camera lens cover always sliding down.  The new Samsung and Nokia is much better in this respect. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:20:45	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
65048466	I bought the BB q10 from T-mobile. Let me begin by writing down some cons, because there are very few:1. If you use a lot of apps (current iPhone or Android user), this phone will disappoint you. Many apps are not available, or are made by 3rd party companies. But in my opinion, apps are generally overrated and over appreciated. The safest app is always your browser. It guarantees SSL and other security. I should never trust a banking app, for instance. Always, access sensitive accounts through your phone's internet browser.2. Smaller screen than iPhone or the BlackBerry z10. If you are used to watching videos on larger screens, then this phone is not for you. Although, I feel the screen is only about an inch smaller than the iPhone. But the Q10 has greater pixel density (336 dpi vs 330 dpi) than the IPhone 4.That's it! I cannot think of any other drawbacks.The pros:1. The call/voice quality is SUPERB! It is amazing how clear the voice of the person I am speaking with sounds. Just compare it with any phone (iPhone, HTC, etc.).2. There touch screen gestures are very useful: swipe up and left to access your communication HUB is great. Also, the ability to multitask and shutdown unwanted apps are way better than iPhone or android.3. The keyboard is the BEST yet. I can type so fast that it astonishes me. I can type a whole paragraph and not make any typos. The autocorrect/learn is exceptional.4. Finally, ActiveSync is here. So your Microsoft exchange/OWA and IMAP e-mail are fully accessible. You can access contacts, folders and subfolders.5. BlackBerry messenger is absolutely amazing. You can call other BBM users via Wifi and send them text, voice, and other attachments. NO SIZE LIMITS!6. The phone is very responsive. I have used the Q10 for a month now. I never had to wait for the phone to wakeup or reboot. It has never crashed. My wife's HTC android phone does that occasionally.7. Front and back camera is finally here on the BB. You can Skype!8. Expandable memory up to 32 GB.9. More system memory than the iPhone 4 (2048 MB vs 512 MB).10. Finally a note about apps. I mentioned the lack of apps in the cons. But I have all the apps I need: Twitter, YouTube, Maps, GoogleMaps (very good 3rd party build), facebook (that I care less about), Navita Language translator, Pandora (3rd party build), DropBox (3rd party), Box (alternative to DropBox), Skype, Weather, DocsToGo (word, excel, power point), Calculator (incl. scientific), Clock (Alarm/World Time/Stop Watch/Timer), QR/Bar code scanner, scanner/convert photos to PDF app, GasBuddy, Slacker Radio, FourSquare, LinkedIn, and more.If you are a current BB user, please buy the Q10 . It won't disappoint you. If you are first-time smart-phone buyer (or looking to switch from iPhone or Android), please give this phone a try. Most carriers allow at least 14 days returns. I believe you will love it.I shall update my review in a few months time.===Update===The BlackBerry 10 devices can run Android apps. Surprisingly, the process is quite easy. Please visit CrackBerryDOTcom or another BlackBerry user forum for instructions and download the application that lets you do this. I have sideloaded over a dozen Android apps on my Q10. They work just fine. Some of them are: Pandora, Dropbox, GoogleMaps, Kindle reader, and the Amazon mp3 cloud player. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:20:45	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
65307519	I've had the phone for a little over a month nowPros:-Box comes packed with accessories. Two batteries. Car charger. Regular charger socket (I requested an Irish and American one and they were happy to oblige). USB cable that fits the socket. Earphones (mine were broken). Instruction manual. Plastic case. 8gb micro SD card.-Screen Protector already fitted.-Runs latest version Android (Ice Cream Sandwich)-Looks very good-Dual SIM function very easy to use. I have both an Irish and American SIM card in at all times and it flawlessly works both at the same time. I receive messages and calls etc. from both when they come in. When sending messages or making phone calls it asks which SIM you would like to use. I have it set to default for one of them (depending on which country I'm in) so it doesn't bother me by asking.-Battery lasts a decent amount of time. I am a hardcore phone user, generally flicking through images and videos online and texting non stop. Battery lasts me for about 6 hours of solid use so should last all day for normal use. The included spare battery is very handy.-Takes micro USB charger (International standard charger)-No problems with signal or dropping calls like some other users have reported.-Speakers are very loud, great for playing music.-Takes panoramic photos. Difficult to get used to but a great feature when used correctly.-Resilient. I've dropped it a few times now and it hasn't been damaged yet. I've been trying to find a case for it but haven't found any that I like on Amazon as of yet. Some other users recommend Samsung Galaxy Note cases for it (they fit when the plastic back is on it according to some reviews)Cons:-Doesn't charge while in use. When I have it plugged in and I have the screen awake the battery percentage doesn't increase (nor does it decrease). I charge it overnight for this reason so it's not a big deal.-Sometimes shuts off when I unplug the charger but turns back on then.-T.V. function is for analogue T.V. only which has been replaced by digital in most countries worldwide so I haven't been able to use this function.-When I received it the home key button was actually scratched pretty badly. The rest of the phone looked flawless though and this didn't bother me enough to request a replacement.-Occasionally the touch screen misbehaves or becomes unresponsive. I find this happens frequently with the charger that was included. I just use an old Samsung charger that I have. The included charger is a bit short also.-The charger port is a little loose. I find that my Samsung charger falls out when moved at all. USB cables fit it perfectly though (which doesn't really make sense as they're supposed to be the same size..?)-Camera and flash not very good. My previous phone also had a 5MP camera with flash and in comparison the Star takes really low quality photos. The flash is the worst flash I have every seen on anything. It is literally just a light. A very dim light at that.Biggest pro is obviously the price. That cannot be beaten!Biggest con is the camera/flash. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:25:32	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	negative comments on camera	true

85153629	Nokia has always been on top with their amazing industrial design. They really have so many years of experience with different technologies, so when it comes to phones, they might know little bit more than all others. The fact that they've though of little details like using Lumia 920's screen with gloves on, pure-black screen settings etc. just gives them so many extra points in this smartphone war.I'm coming from iPhone 5. Which is a great piece of technology as well, but Nokia has something that makes it very friendly and fun to use. Combined with Windows Phone OS, the hardware and software are one piece of tech. A lot of phones suffer from marketing junk that is being added to the phone, cheap materials, inconsistency and just a lot of ugly little add ons that doesn't make it fun to use their products.Nokia Lumia 920 is beautiful. The bright yellow color makes it stand out. The fact that you only touch one setting of theme, and the whole phone changes to that shade is very smart and unique detail. Sure in Android you can add on 100 widgets (which will drain your battery faster and faster) but they're all inconsistent, look like they were made by a 5-year old and just add on nothing more than annoyance.App store is far behind Apple's iOS and Google's Play, which is the only thing that makes you go ohhhhh! with a sad face. It is slowly growing, but it will take sometime for a lot of different apps to do same thing I might want to do on iPhone or Nexus phones.What makes this phone amazing:-design-the way it fits into your hand-pure integration of software with hardware-a lot of user experience surprises that makes you wanna use the phone more and more-screen technology-camera lens-durability and recyclability-UI (user interface) is just like nothing out there-most important apps are there (not all)-originality and colorWhat can be improved:-faster update cycle and little bug fixes-more accessories and headphones-Bluetooth 4.0-more Nokia integration into their technology and services-top 10,000 apps and games must be available across all smartphone platforms.This one is for museums. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:27:50	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
65786621	Not a minor irritation, but a ridiculous real problem: the battery cover does not slide off, cannot be pulled up, it will resist opening. I went around to friends, acquaintances, even a Radio Shack - and nobody could open it. Finally found a way to pry it open, but then it's a problem to close it. The battery is difficult to pull out, and the SIM card holder won't open either. My hope is that I had a defective unit, but I have seen similar reports already.

65290268	This phone is fantastic. I switched from an iPhone 4, mainly because I could write apps for it in Silverlight (since I am a .NET developer by day). While I knew it would be limited compared to an iPhone, I was pleasantly surprised by many features that actually surpass the iPhone. The best feature of the phone, by far, is the music app. Having already had a Zune Pass subscription, being able to download entire albums for free (apart from my monthly subscription, that is) even over-the-air is a great feature. One thing that the iPhone does not support is the Bluetooth AVRCP profile, so after pairing the phone with my car stereo, i can turn on the car, press Play on the dash, and it starts playing music from the phone, entirely wireless, without me even taking it out of my pocket. Then, if I don't like a song, I can hit next on the dash and skip it. The iPhone doesn't support AVRCP, so you have to control it on the phone itself, and the quality of the iPhone audio over bluetooth is no where near the quality of this phone!The browser is okay, but should be getting much better with the update later this year. Many sites optimized for mobile will recognize the mobile version of IE so you can use most iPhone-optimized sites.The only complaint I have about this phone, really the ONLY one, is that the camera is awful compared to the iPhone 4, even compared to the iPhone 3GS. I was really disappointed in the camera, having been spoiled by the iPhone. However, compared to older smartphones and other Android devices, the camera is pretty good, and has an LED flash which helps. Shots outdoors in full sunlight look pretty good, but indoor shots are near worthless. Maybe a software update will help this in the future *fingers crossed*. However, it still doesn't make me wish I had the iPhone back -- the Zune app alone makes this phone killer! 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:34:06	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

I haven't had a single problem with it and I know that this phone has many capabilities I have yet to tap into. I went to a store and the clerk showed me a few fantastic tricks I could do with this phone.  I need to go back and have him train me on these functions.  I love the size of this phone, I can actually see the screen without squinting.  While the Galaxy S4 has a smaller screen size, it is really more advanced but this does everything I could not imagine a phone could do.  Phablet is definitely an accurate description. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:34:06	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
27374475	We did not know that this phone would not work with the Verizon network in the US. There is nothing that stated that before or at the time of purchase. Because the phone was manufactured in the UK, the US Samsung cannot help us. Wireless Everything is only open during the weekdays so if you are trying to get help, you can't do it on the weekends. This has all been very frustrating because although the order was shipped in the time that was promised, it does not actually work with Verizon. There are certain codes that are needed for unlocked phones, and with Verizon it is very hard to obtain the proper codes. DON'T ORDER THIS PHONE IF YOU LIVE IN THE US AND HAVE VERIZON WIRELESS AS YOUR NETWORK CARRIER 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:34:06	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		true

This phone has the worst reception of all phones i've ever had. It has dropped almost every call I have ever had outgoing or incoming. Everytime I tried to send a text message it would always say Retry over and over and over and usually I would just give up. I got so frustrated that one of my friends gave me his old Tmobile phone, a 1997 Motorola with an antenna and no battery cover on the back, and I prefered that phone to this POS Samsung. I will never trust samsung phones again, particularly this brand. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:36:46	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Upgrade	Features	Software		true

66606687	Firstly, Most attractive feature of this phone is the 41 MP Camera thats very cool but Nokia/Microsoft should have taken care of the battery/Hardware considering all other phones in the market. Its very frustrating if your phone drains very fast even without any application running in the background .Few Portals suggest to turn of the applications ,it doesnt make any sense  to shut all the applications, putting your device stand by and use only for Calling  Texting(still the phone drains very fast).Present generation phones are not only meant for Calling but they should perform well with all other multi media stuff (Videos, Camera, Social Networking , Web Reading or browsing etc) . Its a promising attempt to produce this high Mega Pixel (MP) Camera ,would have been worth purchasing if the Battery Life was better. Some times Trouble with the Software ,cannot make a call or answer a call. The focus was only on the 41 MP Camera instead it should have been on the whole device, Unfortunately i had to return the phone and shift to another device . As usual Amazon is best at its Customer Service ,they helped me revert back my upgrade and also refund my bucks3 rating is for the cool intuitive Camera App in 1020 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:36:46	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Upgrade	Applications	Software		true
64792858	Its an OK phone at best, certainly not insanely great anymore and very expensive for what you get.  Battery life is poor at best, and lacks several features of similarly priced or cheaper phones that offer things like expandable storage, swappable batteries and pressure sensitive styluses.  Furthermore it isn't universal so you can't easily switch carriers between LTE providers and the features various carriers offer differ greatly and none is a one stop shop.  Apple needs to stop worrying about making the phone thinner and lighter, and rather add innovation back to the phone like inductive charging or an all day battery. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:39:23	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		true

65504730	This phone is awesome!! It plays music and has amazing talk time. I've definitely talked more than 4 hours on it when fully charged. I'd say about 6 hours when it's fully charged is more appropriate. I don't text or use the internet on my phone--i only talk and listen to music. The only downside is that you need special Sony Ericsson plugs and memory cards to be compatible with this phone, but those were accessories I wasn't worried about buying. I know I'm gonna have this phone for a long long time--so buying a little more for it wasn't a big deal. I found a cheap and useful usb cable and Sony micro M2 SD card for my W518a here on amazon.**(Only the MICRO M2 SD CARD is compatible with this phone!!! not regular micro SD cards!!!)All in all, I love my simple phone. I've dropped it many times and now it's a little chipped--I actually ordered a case for it today--but like I said, I'm gonna have this phone for a long time so getting the neccessities isn't a big deal.

Sometimes, I don't get notifications when I get texts or calls and I have it to where I'd get them, but I get none at all sometimes! Also, the music. The music sometimes doesn't cooperate and won't turn on. Not only that, but the phone shuts off randomly and takes a while to come back on, sometimes I have to press the power button to get it back on, and it does it when FULLY CHARGED. Lastly, silence mode. I have it on silent when I go to school and once, it went off IN CLASS on silent mode! Luckily it didn't get me in trouble...I checked it after it rang- said it was on SILENT!

66462796	99% of cell phone users want a cell phone that works. N96 has a plethora of useless features and wizards that don't work but only frustrate the user. 90% of these addons do NOTHING for us. See below.For instance: after a week of reading all the manuals and online help, I've yet to get the GPS to work in ANY way. I am a techno nerd, a scientist and I embrace high-technology. So when I fail at a FEATURED function of this phone, I know that Nokia did not intend for it to actually work.I've had numerous Nokia phones and most-recently a Sony-Eriksson, and a Sangsung SGH-G608. All have had a nice PC suite that enabled copying of addresses from SIM to phone or mass media, synching with PC, etc. It was also easy to make such transfers without a PC.N96 does not allow simple management of CONTACTS; thus, it fails the most basic function of a phone, something my home portable phones on landline perform easily. It seems obvious that a user should be able to copy and backup contacts among Phone, SIM, mass storage, and PC. But apparently Nokia hasn't thought of that.The N96 does not seem to allow transfer of CONTACTS from SIM to phone, or to my PC. Thus, requiring manual entering of individual contacts. Most, if not all other phones accept contacts from a SIM.I bought one N96 from Amazon for myself to test before I would buy four more for friends overseas. In spite of the slick package, we really need a functional international phone. The Samsung GH608 is superior in all regards, though it doesn't have GPS (moot because the N96 GPS doesn't work). Thus, I'm thinking, eBay for the N96 and iPhone as a possible replacement.The PURPOSE of N96 is to get the user to game and surf online. Pure and simple. The PURPOSE of the N96 is NOT to easily place phone calls, manage contacts and calls. So... if you want to do anything like actually use a cellphone, do NOT get taken in by the N96 hype. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:44:08	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Upgrade	Operating System	Software		true

56880096	The Lumia 920 by Nokia is an excellent phone. I've read many bloggers complain about the 920's heft, it does weigh more than I'm used to, but that fact aside, this is an excellent phone. The weight of the phone makes it feel like a premium device. With all the extras and app exclusives that Nokia is offering, this phone is unbeatable especially at the price. The PureView camera is fantastic, especially in low light conditions and the lenses feature is fun and easy to use. The camera is one of if not the best camera I've used on a mobile device. The Windows Phone 8 OS is super speedy and runs without any hiccups or freezing and really allows for excellent customization. The unibody shell and the curved glass fit perfectly together and complement Windows Phone 8 excellently.

64471690	I bought this phone when it was first released about 2 years ago. let me just say, worst so called smart phone ever. the fancy dandy clear flip screen that was such a draw turned out to be a flop. the only thing that you could do through that flip thing was either look at your pictures or use data and cost money if you didn't have the data package. the screen lock for the flip screen was on the side, so if the phone was inserted into your pocket, the screen lock could come unlocked and the next thing you know, there is a huge charge on your bill for data usage that you never incurred. the phone was slow and not user friendly at all. the interface was complicated and you had to go around your elbow to get to your thumb to complete an action. even something simple such as texting, this phone found a way to make it complicated with the word completion program. you could type 2 letters and it finds the most off the wall words thinking that they were what you meant. i would never recommend this phone to someone looking for a smart phone, unless they like being annoyed and want to smash their phones to bits everytime they use it. needless to say, as soon as possible i upgraded and took out my frustrations on that POS. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:47:45	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Upgrade	Operating System	Software		true

The dedicated camera button can wake the phone, unlock it, and have the user snapping photos immediately.Integration with Skydrive works very well.Cons: Windows app store is kind of limited, but only if you're looking for a few specific apps. There are third-party workarounds for most popular apps. Not compatible with Windows Phone 8 apps unless the developer ports it over.Camera quality is not as great as it should be. Some photos have a yellowish tint to them. This can be fixed with an auto-fix feature that's built-in to the device, but it's an extra step that seems unnecessary. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:55:36	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

65219464	PROS: At the time of release, it was the best of the best. Fast CPU, clear AMOLED screen, and HTCs superior hardware configuration.The 8MP camera is STILL a great spec for a smartphone camera, and it has a great picture and video capture ability.CONS: Like all technology, it needed some upgrades notably a dual core CPU and a bigger screen. Also, replaced the Froyo OS!!!The droid incredible 'S', 2, and 4g are basic incremental updates to this phone and they are still viable smartphones in late 2012.I purchased a HTC droid incredible thru Verizon wireless's CPO program in October 2010, after it had been release spring 2010.I had a few clear intentions: I wanted a certified phone due to the cost and the fact I knew these phones were as good as new.I believe the price w/ 2 year contract was $99 for two phones. My original phone was great, and I had it rooted and ROM'd runningSkyraider 3.5 which at the time was one of the best replacement Android 2.2 roms. I subsequently drowned that phone, andit was replaced with another CPO phone. I again gained root privileges and customized the phone to my needs.Except by this time, Verizon had released the Android 2.3 OTA update. I found a suitable de-bloated version of this OTA and installed it. This phone along with an inexpensive 1900Mah battery that I purchased from a USA seller on 'that auction site' had a long life.However, with the dawn of 4G LTE speed, the larger 4.xx size screens, and the desire for a faster CPU led me to upgrade.But HTC hit a homerun with this phone, probably never to be repeated. It's highly recommended as a 3G smartphone esp if you ROM it!Some of my favorite DINC roms: MIUI, Skyraider 4.x, Cyanogenmod version+, and the ones based on stock gingerbread. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:55:36	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

65261966	The phone does everything I want it to plus a lot more.  No, this is not a smart phone as one review tried to imply.  It has great graphics is very easy to learn how to use.  Great battery life compared to previous phones I have had.  It has great voice recognition that learns on its own.  Overall, I am very happy with this item. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:58:10	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
53360472	This phone is fast, screen looks great, no carrier specific bloat ware - preloaded with Google apps I would have installed anyway like Chrome, Youtube,  Maps.Easy to navigate, easy to customize, and did I mention that it's fast?Better hardware than most top competitors for half the price. Cheap enough to buy without having to re-up a contract, and the hardware is advanced enough now to get me through a few years. Not having to worry about a 2 year contract is awesome. I'm recommending it to everyone I know. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:58:10	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

66771865	I don't usually write product reviews, but this scam is important for you, human being pals, to know.NOTE: If you are expecting to only be able to do calls and send sms, and you are happy with that, then this post is not for you.This post is for the people who believes this thing can replace an iphone, android, or soThe quality of the product in the outside is good, if not excellent, just as you would expect. If you see it at a store, you probably want it.The AMOLED display is just quite different so you will notice its vivid colors to be apart from usual LCDs, and it has good resolution.But...The software is the worst part of all. Nokia is unable to deliver good quality software. The so called Symbian (Anna, or v60, or whatever you want) are terrible pieces of code poorly written, in every aspect.Sumarizing, buying this, also includes (not listed above):- Random restarts (I've never saw my iPhone restart while doing anything...at most, the apps itself crashed...but even that wasn't often).- Unnoticed moments when you in fact can't make (and perhaps receive) calls. I won't go deeper, but I was very surprised to see that I wasn't able to call, and all my friends around me were able to do so. I had to restart the phone in order to solve this, so this is CLEARLY phone issue, not network issue (so don't argue in favor of Nokia).- Music player can't go beyond many songs when playing. It just crashes before you end up listenning to music, with an included restart (yes, everything that was open, goes to hell).Besides, you need to be somehow enthusiast about resetting your phone every once in a while.The first time was because (Ok, my fault) I mistakenly entered my Nokia account password. After that, an invisible app to the user in behalf of various nokia services (maps, store, social, exchange) was attemping to connect, but with wrong credentials, the only thing it was doing was to drain my battery cellphone. The workaround while I thougth I would find a solution, was to check my phone constantly for that app, and then close it.Ok, reset the phone!. Next, The music library wasn't able to load music correctly. No more than 800 songs or so. Ok. formatted microSD, phone internal memory, erase every trace of it in my Macbook, reset, and then restore music. Fine, it finally looks ok.But guess what? Now, suddenly, my installed apps manager is not able to show all of them. I cannot install apps from ovi store nor .sis files anymore. Ok, at this point you should be an expert in the resetting business: Format microSD, format internal, *#7370#, connect to WLAN, connect to ovi store, redonwload everything. Download maps, set voice assisted driving GPS. change positioning server from nokia to google (as their also-bad-written-code-for-positioning server takes forever to know where you are). Setup emails, Facebook, twitter, foursquare, re-sync contacts, re-sync music, photos. Go to camera, set maximum quality for pictures (why would I want to save pictures of 6 MP if the produced 8M pictures are 600 kb in size? Nowadays, that quantity is nothing). Set profiles, tones, screensaver to nothing....etc Done. Now what!!??? My smartphone is slow as hell. Ok, one reset more. Oh and by the way syncing music is a pain. Because the also-bad-written nokia multimedia manager is not smart (because the phone is the one that should be), and then uploads your songs, within nice folders ordered by artists and albums. But guess what? To open them, the phone needs to build a database...and to build it, it needs to read the WHOLE Sounds folder. Why in hell is not the desktop manager able to build this database while uploading files and at the end upload this database? It takes forever to sync music, and after that the Refresh library step takes another eternity. If you add a new song...be prepared, because your smartphone needs to scan all the Sounds folder again. It makes sense, because the phone doesn't know where the file was uploaded, nor the artist, nor nothing. So scan everything....right? So idiot approach...Really, really, really, please don't buy this as it's poorly designed software will make you hate this thing.Pre-answers:It is meant only for social things. Yes, but the preinstalled nokia social apps is crap. You will need to get/buy better apps. And guess what? Since Nokia didn't came up with push notifications, you need to have all your social apps open and connected (if this is your case, not mine), draining your battery.You can't expect a perfect OS. Even other brands has faults. Yes, but what about support? All you will find on internet is a bunch of another users asking for help in Nokia forums. Seriously, the support page only has obvious FAQs, and a forum. Nothing else. Just do a quick google for the problems I've had: SSO nokia application uninstall SSOUI nokia refresh library not working nokia cannot install apps nokia unable to install apps nokia (you'll find some unsolved posts from 2006!!). This is the proof that I'm not lying to you.Plus:-To capacitive touch sensor is not as precise as other phones. Be prepared to tap accidentally on things, since your thumb, which can't go anywhere while holding your phone, will cause this.-Hardware buttons can't be used while the phone is soft-locked. Seriously, why do I have 5 buttons in this thing if I can't even change to the next song while the phone is locked?? I had to buy an app for that....shame on me.-User interface loves to appear quick questions while anothers appear, so you will answer something to some question.-Downloads from web browser are automatic, if you clic on something that downloads anything, it will start automatically.-If you use earphones to listen to music, and change phone to silent, you won't hear any notification of calls, sms, etc. OK, thats abvious, profile name is silent. If you change it to general, then the sound goes to earphones and smartphone speaker. So, its your choice, everything or nothing.-If you don't upgrade to Symbian Anna, be prepared for buggy wlan connections (the settings say it wouldn't connect, but it will). With Anna, you reduce this weird thing to almost 0 (but not 0).-You will have to upgrade to Anna. Everything I said happens on Anna. The previous version looks like a Beta compared to Anna. And Anna looks like a Beta compared to anything. Picture that...-There are a lot of minor stupidities that you only say I couldn't expect less than that.I would return this, but unfortunately I can't as it came in a carrier plan.Anyone who wants to discuss this, be my guess. There is a quote in software development that says:Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot- proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning. Whether apple and google had already beaten the universe and their software is idiot-proof (including me), or Nokia can't win the universe. Of these options, I think there is a third one: Nokia is the idiot itself, not the users.One more: no wifi turn-off option. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 22:59:52	Complaint	Unable to Use	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Internal Hardware		true

33511580	The phone is great.  It's fast and responsive, it takes excellent photos, the speakers are great, and the phone itself is the perfect size. Here's the big but - the screen shatters easily.  I've had a lot of smartphones and I haven't experienced as much as a single screen crack with any of them.  However, after having this phone for one month, the screen shattered (and I mean completely shattered) after a fall from a twelve-inch height where the device landed flat on its back (not on its side).  It still works just fine in every possible way, I just can't really see what I'm doing anymore.  I'm pretty disappointed in the lack of resilience the screen exhibited.  Upon a quick search I discovered that this is a known problem with the phone.  Apparently, the screen even has a tendency to shatter on its own under certain conditions. I'm pretty bummed.  I wish I had known before I bought the phone.  If I had, I would have definitely sprung for the insurance and I recommend that you do if you buy this phone. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:02:28	Compliment		Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Display		true

65039957	I haven't had this long, but I'm really liking it, so far.  I could still make a long list of cons, but it wouldn't be as long as my list of pros.The main thing I want to concentrate on is all the dumb apps that ATT; and Samsung feel obligated to push on it's customers.  I thought Samsung was getting away from doing that years ago, but my last few phones have been Motorola's and they were much better at not pushing their apps on you.It's just frustrating, because no one wants to use an app that's poorly supported and probably won't be around long, anyway.  At least not when there's usually far greater alternatives out there.  It takes a lot of time to filter through and identify all the junk, before finally removing it, if possible at all.  The sad thing is that all the effort that goes into these apps could have been used on improving the GUI software on the phone.  There are simply things that would be easy to do, that everyone would likely enjoy, such as better notification methods.I've always been disappointed in the slow development of mobile phone software, and while it's finally gotten much better in recent years, it still has much room for improvement. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:04:01	Complaint	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
70531525	This phone is a great buy. For starters you can see and fell the amount of design work done on it. When you hold it in your hand it feels like a quality product and the way it slopes on the sides helps for your hand to cradle it. Also the way all the manual buttons (volume, power/lock, camera) are on the side of the phone allows for you to intuitively use the phone one handed despite its larger size. I was skeptical of the wireless charging as first, seemed like a frivolous add on, but I have to admit it is nice to just pick the phone up off the charge pad. The camera has been pushed hard by Nokia and I have to admit it takes some great low light photos and you have to work to take a shaky photo with it. Also I feel like the image quality is clearer than your typical smartphone camera. The screen is also very impressive. It does as advertised work with gloves on and in direct sunlight increased the contrast on the screen so items pop out a bit more which is great when you trying to read an email on the go. In addition I don't feel the glare from the sun is all that noticeable.The introduction of the dual core processor is an improvement over the WP7 I had, it makes an already smooth OS even smoother and very responsive. The many Nokia apps are easy to use and stable as well as just fun to use. City lens is the best AR food app I have used so far. Overall it is a great phone and would recommend it to anyone. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:04:01	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

64281162	7/12/11 I'm on my fourth week of the Beta OS 5, and this should effectively kill all the silly complaining about things an iPhone wont do. A night and day improvement, and not much need to jailbreak your phone anymore. All the details are on Apple's website, and according to most sources this new OS will be available to the general public this fall.Below is my original review: (BTW, I have NO knowledge of this seller or the condition of their phones, this information is not an endorsement of FGS Trading, and I would suggest that anyone considering buying from an Amazon seller make contact with them prior to completing any transaction with a full list of questions.)I had the 8GB 3G model and thought that was great, until I got a demo of the iPhone 4. Man is this version is light years ahead of the original model.With a 1Ghz CPU, and 16GB of flash memory, this thing is a portable office/entertainment center par excellence. I've had this phone for 3 months without a single problem, the display is nice and sharp, the apps load very fast, and I now have over 130 apps to perform just about every duty you could possibly think of with absolutely no impact on performance. And on the ATT 3G network, I average download speeds of around 3Mbps, and over 1M upload speeds....and how do I know that, cause I got an app that tells me that's how. BTW, the display is the equivalent of a 960x640 on your desktop so what you see is essentially a high res yield and page loads are superfast. And resident memory (512Mb), after a full days use I just checked and still had 120Mb of Ram available. On the 3G model that number was usually down around 4Mb by the end of the work day and had to be refreshed.Even the battery life is 3x better than the previous model, and thats a good thing cause its integrated but a full charge should yield and entire days work of calls, emails, surfing the web, SMS messaging, and play. I no longer need my laptop cause there's nothing I cant do with the iPhone, and that includes sending faxes, editing Excel or Word documents, and even printing. A flash for the 5MP camera, two(2) HD video cameras, and even real time video conferencing over a wireless network, and Bluetooth that unlike the 3G model is actually compatible with everything you throw at it, including Garmin GPS....just amazing. This thing even has 2 mics with noise suppression so calls are clearer on the other end.BTW, with all the apps, music, and videos I've got loaded on this thing I've still got 10GB of flash memory remaining. I cant imagine why anybody would need more storage, and the 32GB model isn't any faster and doesn't have any more features. You'll need iTunes on your desktop to get the most out of this phone and iTunes can be a little intimidating at first but its worth the trouble, and all the instruction you need can be found on the web or Youtube for transferring photos, videos, music, apps, etc.I've been reading with amusement about the antenna problem with the iPhone 4 and have this to say..... It is easily cured by slapping on a hard case or shell on the phone, which eliminates the issue I see some people complaining about. I have personally never experienced this issue because I left the ATT; store with a protective shell on my phone which virtually everybody I've ever seen with an iPhone has anyway. Very simply you CANNOT replicate the reported death grip problem with a shell around the outer frame. Cant be done. And BTW, I don't know if its due to network improvements or what but lately I'm getting 4Mbps download speeds so if anything I'm happier with my purchase now than I was 4 months ago but I live in Florida and cell sites are plenty down here, if you live in California or New York you may not be so fortunate. Zero complaints, and that's something most smartphone users of other OEM products can't say.Also, amongst the disinformation you'll read about the iPhone here on Amazon one guy states the screen is easily scratched and the back is easily shatterable. Utter nonsense. First of all, ALL cell phones are shatterable, and the iPhone screen is made from Gorilla Glass, a proprietary Corning product that quite simply does not scratch. You can read up on this on the web but after a while you will feel comfortable dropping your phone in your pocket or purse with your keys, power tools, pistols, whatever. I've dropped my phone a couple of times and it has not shattered and the screen is still perfect after 4-5 hours of use per day.I caution you to beware negative reviews on here that are filled with bad English and are authored by individuals who have written only one review (on the iPhone) and posted it in several locations on Amazon's site. Its easy to pick these out, and many have no doubt been written by the same person.And finally, the Wall Street Journal did an article on the iPhone 4 recently that concluded the following 1) ATT; network is 46% faster than Verizon for iPhone users, 2) many reported problems with poor service and dropped calls are an ATT; network problem, and not associated with the iPhone, and 3) call quality is better on Verizon's network vs. ATT.; There are pros and cons to both carriers but bottom line is.....IT AIN'T THE PHONE! I've posted a link to the article under Comments. Also a definitive technical review by Anandtech.com is posted there, and yes they cover the much overblown antenna issue. The iPhone is still the biggest seller in the market, and for a reason.Oh wait, about 2-3 times a month my girlfriend gets mad at me and hangs up in the middle of a conversation, so I guess I am suffering from the dreaded dropped call after all. haw haw 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:04:01	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

I use my dropbox and Spotify. So not much of sync my Music/Videos much on my side. So 8GB is more than enough for me. This phone ran great. No ATT; or T-mobile Bloatware. Those things will slow down your phone so much and I hated them.The only thing you need to watch out for is ATT; 4G LTE is not compatible with Nexus 4G radio frequency. It will only work for T-Mobile in Certain area in San Jose. You will able to find more article online about this. The only thing I can get out of ATT is HSPA really sad. For regular user, it is not a big deal. But I was really wanted to use my phone to be mobile hotspot. And ONE great thing about Nexus 4 is you are automatically get the Mobile HotSpot without subscribe to their extra data package. But watch out for hitting your limit.Overall, it is a great phone and it is really 1 of the best phone out there at this time.Updated: (7/14/13)I rode a mountain bike trail with my phone. I was doing downhill and my phone dropped out of my packet. I was down 10 meters before I could stop and looked for my phone. I thought I broke another phone. But this phone won't quit. The screen is really tough, not even a scratch after the fall. Even it was face down when  I found it on top of bunch of rocks. it only have 2 cosmetic dents on the plastic rim side. Otherwise the phone is working as usual. Really 1 tough phone! 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:13:17	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

23925467	I bought from #34; VoltageStore#34; . NEW! $590.00 No warranty since it's not sell in U.S.The phone comes from Abra, which is kinda weird for me, but I successfully set up my language.Some people doubt if the phone comes from factory, you may check online Nokia.com with the code that is on the box.The phone I bought from this store is RM 821 unlocked. The price is a little higher than other sellers. Amazon didn't do a good job on packing the phone. Not in a box, but in a yellow paper bag. :(The phone is very wonderful. I use my bf's G-phone4 Nexus LG, the picture quality makes a big difference. Nokia does a great job, everything at night looks very clear. I can see my finger tip clearly when I take a close picture. Carl Zeiss is very great!The phone runs faster than iPhone. Glad, I wouldn't be like #34;other apple people#34;,they are the same. I like to be special. :)Plus, iphone is easy to break. haha.The sound quality may not as good as apple. maybe because of the headphone.I trust Nokia.The only weird thing that happens is that the calendar shows up Arabian even if i type in Chinese. It changes to Arabian when I see the table calendar. However, when I click it, it shows Chinese. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:13:17	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
66532038	I have owned this phone for a little under a month now and i am satisfied with it. I chose the Nokia because I don't think any phone should cost more. And this one was $200 well spent.Here are the facts:It looks great; sleek, clean and even though it has the same form factor as its competitors it still stands out. (even though the windows logo looks like it doesn't belong on the phone)battery life is way better than i expected, i average about 3hr talk time daily, my wireless is always on and i use browser frequently during day and i manage about 20 hr before battery gets critically low.Its not as fragile as it looks or feels. Because I paid only $200 I don't worry about dropping it or getting it scratched. The gorilla glass is a big help and the shell is just as awesome.browser is fast on WiFi and cell network. I benchmarked it against iPhone 4 and5, Samsung galaxy 4 and it is just as fast. The differences in performance were negligible.Call quality is excellent.I comes factory unlocked and none of the iTunes drama to deal with.There is a dark side.....The the user interface is clumsy... Takes a while to get familiar with it.Keypad is ok but text inputs are tedious. The cursor never goes where you want it. Selecting text for editing and copying is almost impossible. I find myself backspacing to correct errors or edit content. (writing review from phone and its taking for ever, even with a stylus. I hope they send a software update to fix or improve)The app environment is easy to navigate. But selection isn't impressive. I am especially dissapointed that real racing 3 is still not available. Even though I will never need or use more than 15 apps at any given moment, the luxury of choice just doesn't exist with windows phone. the essential apps work fine and get the job done.The camera isn't that great... Out performed by iPhone but not a real issue (it is after all, a phone)Home screens unattractive.... They could have done better.the truth is I can live with all the cons and at the end of the day its a phone that works well, I didn't have to pay $600 for it, I really couldn't have made a better decision 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:16:01	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

65731165	Excellent phone it still works on virgin mobile. Has great signal strength, crystal clear phone calls, nice and handy handset bar phone. My favorite thing is the built in flashlight that's good when you need the most if your in a dark room or if the power goes out. Plus You can text, make calls and has a few built in games. I forgot to write a review, got it on amazon October 2 2013. I had the Kyocera rave K7 royale long time ago but gave it away and made a mistake, so I tried this new Kyocera k9. Virgin mobile is a good service for pay as you go. They have decent plans 20 dollar plan for 400 mins for a medium talker. Need to talk to virgin mobile to update plans or check your minutes dial *vm that's *86 and dial. Great basic phone, who needs the internet on a phone. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:16:01	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

66047612	I purchased Blackberry Bold 9700 phone from 11TH STREET WIRELESS INC through Amazon and till date this phone has given me a lot of trouble. I live in India and purchased it during my business trip and hence I couldn't return this phone as well. None of the accessories including charger, hands-free headphone seem to be functioning fine. The worst part is the battery. Even if I charge it fully, in the mid way the phone gets switched off causing a lot of annoyance. I replaced the battery once but no use. The USB charger also gives trouble sometimes. Sometimes, I am unable to open the SMS received by me and can't reply to the sender. I am using it since I paid a very good amount for it but really disappointed with this seller and even with Amazon. I am really repenting on my decision on buying this phone.I have decided not to purchase any electronics goods from Amazon henceforth since don't trust the sellers that they have registered on their website. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:18:56	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		true

32019027	I love my new Nokia Lumina 920 Yellow phone!  It integrates perfectly with work (E-Mail, Calendar, Lync, SkyDrive,Office, etc.) and my personal life.  The user experience is fluid and easy to learn.  The People Hub brings all my friends, contacts, and family into an easy to follow area where through one live tile I can drill down to see my wall on facebook, updates on linkedin, etc.  All of my family also got a Nokia Lumina 920 phone which includes my wife and three boys.  Everyone finds it easy to use.  XBOX music gives you unlimited free music for our family members by upgrading our XBOX Live family account.  I have used XBOX Smartglass on my phone to control the XBOX we use for our home entertainment center using my phone to bring up playlists, Netflix, etc.  We have tons of app's we have downloaded missing very view games and a few other capabilities teenagers love.  You can take a snapshot of your screen on the Windows 8 phone.  Nokia Drive is excellent along with the other Nokia app's. I find the one step upload of pictures to Facebook super simple.  Take picture click share type message and it is posted.  Don't have to open any app's to do these basic tasks.  The twitter app Rowi works great.  The screen resolution is excellent I do not need my reading glasses to read info on my phone.  The camera works as good as my digital camera and I have it set up to upload my pictures to SkyDrive automatically.  I can log on with my Windows Live ID on any device Computer, Tablet, or phone and see my SkyDrive content.  I also love the wireless charging.  When my phone needs charging (ever other day) I set it on my wireless charging plate and it charges.  Once you use wireless charging you will never want to go without it.Good luck in making your choices there is more than enough good feedback on this phone to show it is a no brainer that this is the best phone out on the market right now.  Windows 8 phone is a fantastic operating system.  I have purchased a Windows 8 Surface (multiple for family and my parents) and we have upgraded our non-touch enabled PC to Windows 8.  Thank you Microsoft for the innovation and market leading solutions you are providing.  It is only going to get better with the seamless integration of my work and personal life with future releases of your software.  Thank you Nokia for bringing your high quality engineering and design work to the Windows 8 platform.  I think the Nokia and Microsoft partnership is brilliant! 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:22:30	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

14196432	I have used a lot of phones. From Apple, to android and then Windows.This phone has a impressing hardware but at the same time, disappointed software.One serious issue is that I can not go back to the previous page on Internet Explore.  If I push go back button, it will go back directly to homepage which is really stupid. I do not really understand is this only my issue or the phone's issue.  Because if it is phone's issue, many people should mentioned it already.  Also, if you read a long article and want to go back to the top, you need to swipe fingers several times but on a Android  phone, it is very easy to adjust your position.  It will be help to have direction button on the keyboard since that way, it will be easier to change letters during a word but as far as I know, only Android phone has it.Also, so many apps available on App store or Play station cannot be found in windows store and some of them are necessary for my daily life. Furthermore, some software just can not behave on this phone as good as my old HTC.  It also need a longer time to sync.Android has the best mail system in my opinion. Lumia's mail system is okay and personally, I like it better than apple's mail system.Battery life is reasonable.  It has twice life time of my old HTC phone which basically lives on the charger.. and Nokia has a useful offline GPS system which I believe most phones do not.This is a good phone, but if I was not that eager to buy a new phone, I would not buy it at this time.  Still a lot of things need to improve.  To be honest, I do not think this one can compare to Iphone or even Android phone now except the much cheaper price but it worthies to try if you are curious. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:24:07	Comparison	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

65965359	I am a very big fan of Samsung phones. I have been using Samsung phones for years. During these years their phones became better. I especially like their Galaxy line. This phone is my latest addition. So far it worked for me up-to my expectations. The phone is equipped with latest and extremely useful applications. easy to use interface. Actually a bit getting used to time is necessary; but understanding the phone and its operations is quite easy. Very sensitive and easy to use, fast working touch screen. Actually that division is vastly developed comparing to past models. Anyway the protection of touchscreen is very important. A proper dust cleaning method is mandatory to keep the performance of the phone to an optimised level. So Use of a cleaning wipes such as25 iCloth Avionics Cleaning Wipes for Flightdeck Displays, Ipad touch screen, Monitors - Aerospace Grade Dupont Sontara Wiperis vitally important. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:27:54	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

64568396	This phone is great.  I give the phone 5 stars.  I rate the Tracfone customer service as ZERO.  Tracfone customer service is simply awful.  The problem I had with customer service is that none if the employees had a clue as to how to port my old cell phone number to the Tracfone.  There is a feature on the Tracfone website that supposedly allows an existing phone number to be transfered to a new Tracfone.  This feature is useless because after all the information is submitted nothing happens. After waiting three days for Tracfone to activate the phone, I called customer service.  I was informed that I needed a different SIM card for the old number to be ported.  After 5 days I received the new SIM card via FedEx.  After installation of the new SIM card, the phone did not activate.  I called Tracfone again and after being passed around 4 times to various people who did not have a clue on how to activate the phone, finally I was passed to a lady that told me that I needed to remove the new SIM card and reinstall the one that orgiinally came with the phone.  She was able to activate the phone after 45 minutes of trying.  I would recommend the phone only with the condition that it be shipped with a new working phone number.  Do not attempt to have Tracfone port your existing number to a new phone. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:29:33	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

64288014	Do not even consider purchasing this phone.As a Nokia fan and owner of a N95-3 (a great device), everything about this phone looked  sounded great.  It has all the same featues packed into a sleeker, more attractive body, with a higher end screen and equivalent battery life, for a lower price.  Sounds perfect, in theory.But... spend some time reading comments around Amazon and other review sites, and you'll notice a common theme: horrible build quality.  It seems Nokia has cut so many corners on component quality to drive the price of the N85 down that you stand little chance to get one that will work properly for a decent length of time.I've personally been through 2; the first worked well for 1 week and then the in-ear speaker quit working, so I couldn't hear anybody on the other end. An inexplicable component failure I've never seen in other handsets regardless of brand.  The second unit appeared to be okay for the first couple days, and then on any call that lasted more than 10 minutes, would start to randomly cut in and out, mysteriously dropping words  entire sentences, and sometimes dropping the call altogether.  Thought it was the network the first couple times, but as a regular occurrence 2-3 times a day (with full bars) realized it was definitely the phone.Read other reviews and you'll see a multitude of other quality issues, including dust under the screen, creaking buttons, hardware freeze-ups, etc.You may think to yourself, good phone at a good price, I'll take my chances and hope I get one that works, but no, DON'T do it.  I am pleading with you, don't even try it, because the phone will fail - under warranty if you're lucky - or possibly 8 months down the road, and you'll be out $300 and feeling stupid.  Get an N95 instead, or an N97 if you have the cash. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:31:02	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	Upgrade	Operating System	Internal Hardware		true

65397540	Upgraded from HTC Evo.  Got the phone from Sprint.  Signal strength is terrible compared to old phone.  I'm roaming in my house constantly because reception is so poor.  Sprint now giving free Airave mini cell towers for people to use plugged into their home wifi to boost indoor signal.  They actually told me there might be a problem with my roof.  No, not when I've had Sprint for more than two years in the exact same house.If signal strength is important to you, then this is not the right phone.  Great looking.  Great features except for it really isn't built to be a PHONE.  Geez. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:32:57	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		true

60097201	The phone itself is Great, a very well made phone. The con....its locked to Verizon Wireless, it cant be used outside of The USA without first unlocking the GSM slot.....I hear you....I hear you...a code can be purchased on line,....but this isn't easy. Ive tried several sites and the answer is the same...NO CAN DO. I have sent a mail to Verizon asking for help, but I'm not holding my breath.Why anyone would allow a phone ( locked to a wireless network in the USA and that cannot be used other than in the states ), to be shipped overseas is beyond me. Knowing this  I would not have bought this phone. Its a crying shame, because I love the phone. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:34:31	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

48232884	I've had 2SG's, 13.Absolutely loved them.  Got talked into this new LG2 because of the better camera and much better battery life. Apparently I have aliens trying to broadcast through my fillings or something, because the incoming call sound quality is HORRIBLE!!!  Static and breaking up so bad I only get every other word, the volume is so weak I couldn't hear it ring from my purse on my side. I downloaded a speaker booster app which improved it by atleast 50#8541;. I thought the static and blurbs I hear when someone is speaking was just a defective phone, so I took it back to the store and had the guys try it and they couldn't hear the stuff I was hearing even when I was listening in. They gave me another anyway and its exactly the same.....my husband can't hear it either. I know I'm not crazy, I have to get folks to repeat, repeatedly ....is it just me or does anyone else hear this mess I hear ? I've had better sound from walkie talkies. The computer stuff is all fine, everything works just right.

65496283	Purchased this to await a new Pre from HP because it was cheap and un-locked. It's not really the fault of the phone (except for the keyboard issue), but of the operating system. Symbian is horrible. Completely unintitutive with layers of junk to sift through before being able to accomplish the simplest of tasks.  I finally had to print out the entire operating instructions and read them page-by-page before I could go much beyond the phone function.  The touch screen also leaves a lot to be desired.  It's extremely un-responsive and doesn't even register a touch at the edges when one is playing games. The slide-out qwerty keyboard is a disaster.  I don't have particularily large fingers and had minimal trouble typing on my old Palm Treo keyboard, but I cannot EVER type a message of any kind on this thing without pressing adjacent or incorrect keys! After using the wonderful PalmOS for so many years I just can't get over how awkward using this phone is and can't wait to get rid of it. For using as a plain-vanilla phone it's perfectly fine, which is why I gave it two stars instead of only one, but then it's overkill to pay even this much. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:36:14	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Display		true
64596355	I bought this phone for my 90 year old father.  The large number buttons make it much easier to use for him than his previous mobile phone.

64656248	I've had the pleasure of owning this phone for over a year.  I am currently ordering a replacement digitizer so that I can continue to get life out of this phone.  When I had searched for a Phone, I was looking for small size, physical qwerty, 5+ camera and touch screen.  This phone fit all of this perfectly.  I have been able to get a lot of use out of this phone both in the states and outside.  I have never had any major issues with the phone, it still slides perfectly as the day I bought it.  I've put this through a lot of abuse over the year and it keeps on trucking.So if you are looking for a few simple things in a phone and don't want a 4 brick in your pocket, this or it's follow up the SK17a would be a great choice.I will mention that I do not have a data plan, most places now have wifi and I have separate navigation because I don't want to carry around a 4 phone just to use my navigation once a year.  I just really don't need to stay connected to people that often when I'm not around some wifi anyway.  Texting works just great for those places where there is no wifi.What do I like:-size, the 2.5 screen is designed well and fits perfect into your hand-takes great pictures if you aren't looking for 1500$ camera pictures-the well thought out physical qwerty, I rarely need keys that aren't already there-the microSD slot, don't have to upgrade my phone because I want more space-**plug and play ability for music, I'm constantly adding/taking away music with just sliding folders over, no extra software-built in stand for standing the phone on its side, you'd be surprised how often you use it when its there.-gmail sync-google voiceWhat I don't like:-This phone can be very sluggish at times especially when texting quite a bit-**referring to the ease of adding music which I like, the music player is terrible for setting up playlists and the software makes it so you have to sync up your library again and its just a hassle, if you use iTunes, get doubleTwist and save yourself some headaches-you only get 4 options on the main screen, choose wisely-my contacts and calls are in two separate programs, taking up two of my four spots when they could easily take up one. I could have just the one for calls but I do use the contacts enough that I don't like having to go down a page and then click, its not essential but it is annoying for how I use this phone.-battery battery battery... it's life is terrible, keep the chargers (yea you are going to need at least 2) very close if you talk on the phone a lot-moving icons around is a nightmare at times, I imagine this can happen on any phone but the compact screen makes for an extra fun nightmare-DO NOT even turn this phone on without a screen protector, don't get me wrong the phone can take a beating but the screen scratches very easily, seriously admire it from inside the wrapping until you have a clean room and a screen protector to put on it.-The texting screen is a bit cramped with a huge box for language at the bottom that is just unnecessary and the whole contact coming down randomly from the top, you are lucky to get two lines of text in between them.In conclusion I will say that I enjoy this phone very much even with all of its quirks and I will likely look into getting the SK17a or something similar after this phone has run its course.  I think that the phones of today have gotten too big for their use and I really like using my phone for just that, a phone.  It's not a TV or a video console so lets not try to turn something into something it is not.  It boils down to use and while I do wish this phone had better battery life, be less sluggish (faster processor) and a bit better design of the OS, I believe the SK17a has resolved all of these issues. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:40:50	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true
65833351	This phone is sexy from the keypad to the box that it comes in. However, it is VERY sensitive to heat and touch, and will go psycho very quick. The Mp3 player is of good quality and holds more than most phones with Mp3s. The earpiece volume is pretty low and leaves  a lot to be desired. Basically, this phone is good for getting compliments, but not very talking friendly, much like the RAZR. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:41:50	Compliment		Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Enclosure		true
66014320	I won't go into deals about the phone because I think others have done really good reviews (read reviews from the gray phone as well) but I will go into details about my experience.Here are few things I want to focus on:1- INTEGRATION: what I mean here is the integration between apps and the main functionality of the phone. I use the calling feature a lot ( expected ) but also I don't want to launch each individual social app to find someone I want to SMS/Chat/Call. Basically it has a universal contacts so if you use Tango/Viper/WhatsApp/Skype/Google Voice you will find it so easy to find the person and do whatever you want. I make lots of international calls so I use 3rd party app to make phone calls (along with GVoice). I've used this 3rd party with the iPhone but it was buggy and it always crashes plus I have to launch it each time and find a person to call. With Android, I can just configure the app to be used when I call internationally. The same goes for Google Voice.2- NOTIFICATION: I use social apps like WhatsApp alot but with the iPhone it used to drain battery and not work properly with the iOS notification. I've to open it all the time to make sure someone is talking to me. The notification for this phone (probably Android thing) is just amazing. With the power and memory of this phone, all apps just push their notification smoothly. Slide down with your finger from top to bottom and you see all your notifications. It could get annoying but you can always turn it off or silent your phone.3- S-PEN: As others have mentioned, this is probably the best part of the phone. I can't imagine not using it and believe me you will just love it. It has so much features and is very precise when writing. I use it almost all the time.4- BATTERY: I charge the phone at night only. I use it from the time I wake up till I charge it again at midnight. I won't exaggerate if I say that I use it heavily from sending emails, to lots of FB to youtube to all social apps (Skype/SMS/WhatsApp/Viper/Tango) to email and lots of browsing and it will survive till the end of the day. The screen is almost on 75% of the time. I have to say that while it is not a PC but I've not used my PC that much since I got this phone.5- SPEED: with all the points above, switching between all the apps I work with is just blazing fast. No lag whatsoever. It is very fast and loads quickly.6- MULTI-TASKING: You can literally use two apps at the same time (not all apps though). Just drag an app from the side menu to the screen and it will split both ups (top and bottom)7- AUTO-COMPLETE/SENTENCE COMPLETION: it is so amazing smart I literally type few letters and it gives me so many options to finish. It also predicts the next word based on your selection and you type a 15 words SMS in 5 seconds. As an FYI, it does this for more than ONE language I use (English/Arabic). With the iPhone, it was really a piss off. Each time it overwrites what I type and I keep hitting the erase/back key on the keyboard.8- CONTINUOUS WRITING: For both languages I use - again - I just move the S-PEN (or my finger) on the keyboard and it will accurately finish words for me. I am honestly surprised at its accuracy. About 90% of the time it is always correct. English accuracy is higher than when I type in Arabic.9- SIMPLE MOBILE/T-MOBILE: I live in Northern VA and there are so many new towers with the 1900 band. However only when I am next to them I get 3G/HSPA+ but the speed - while driving; I know :) - is about 5.5Mbps down and 2.5Mbps uploads. 99.9% of the time I am on EDGE. I might move to Simple Talk but to be honest I do a lot of SMS internationally. If Simple Talk will cut off my line when sending couple of International SMSs then that would be crazy. The majority of my time is at work or at my home. At work I use the PC so I don't care about 3G/4G while at home I use my Wifi. At the end of the day, you need to really evaluate your needs. EDGE is more than enough for me for email/light social apps.10- TABLET ALTERNATIVE: I would only use a table for reading books since I've 100's of technical PDF books. I've read few large Apress PDF technical books and I can see myself reading from this phone straight. I don't think it will be ideal but it was just so hard on the iPhone since I was constantly zooming in and out.11- FINGERPRINTS: I am not sure if I read some reviews that said it does not get fingerprints easily but this is not true. It is like a magnet and don't listen to their reviews.Finally, I was lucky to get my two phones from Amazon LLC and not a third party seller. I just don't trust these guys for the amount I paid for my phones and I was lucky to get the last two white ones. I've really enjoyed the phone every time I use it and it is worth every penny. I don't think I need to jump to any phone for few years to come (unless I break this, hopefully not).Finally thanks to all the previous 5-star reviewers here at Amazon. They've done really a good job giving this phone with it deserves. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:41:50	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

90893471	This phone is awful. Number one if you're expecting a galaxy s3 or anything even close look again. I bought this knowing its a knockoff and not expecting much and I'm still horribly disappointed. It looks nothing like the pictures and is significantly smaller than the galaxy s3. It is not even an android system, it is set up exactly like the flip phones I used in eighth grade like 6 years ago. You cannot download apps, get on the internet without trying to throw the phone, or customize or change much at all. The camera is awful but that is actually on here and I knew it would be bad before I got it. The phone barely stays on I find myself having to turn it back on after it randomly turns off at all day. One good thing I can say is that the battery lasts FOREVER, but that's because I LITERALLY CANNOT RUN ANYTHING- facebook, internet, email.... nothing. There are better knockoff phones I know that for sure. This is a GIANT waste of money no matter what carrier you are using. Also, I am using this for straight talk and still haven't gotten the internet set up because the APN settings are just ridiculous and nothing how they should be. So I would definitely reccommend NEVER getting this. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:44:41	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Camera		true

65571690	Just got this phone on Friday, November 23.  It's a nice big screen, good graphics, but it is kind of slow.  Takes a few seconds to load home page after being in an app.  The camera is nothing to write home about either.  The most frustrating part is that Verizon released it before there were any cases ready for it, so I am using it unprotected.  Overall it's a good phone for the price.  I will see how much I still like it this week after using it more.  May have to return and get the new iPhone. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:48:27	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

59217363	No Drive Letter: no traditional means of referring to folders understands what Computer\HTC6435LVW\Internal storage means. With previous phones with SD cards, I was able to do this. The HTC DNA has NO removable drive SD Card so I can't plug it into my computer and search for files by extension, date etc. I tried to copy the whole 13 GB worth of data from the phone to the PC but after 5 tries it kept failing so I don't know what I have copied and what failed (no error messages).I'm trying to pull in some graphics from about 15 different photo apps and short video clips from a few video apps and I have NO IDEA where the file folders are. The apps don't let me specify and there's no documentation. A simple search by extension and date would cure it - then just click a file to see if it's right and copy or cut / paste it so I can begin (BEGIN!!!) doing my editing work on the video. Now it's 3 days later and I'm no closer than I was before. I have a ton of great pics and some good video clips on the HTC DNA internal storage. Unfortunately I can't use them in my production.I originally rated this phone a 5, but for actual work related productivity I can only give it a 2 as a social media phone where I can upload and share photos  videos immediately after taking them, but obviously I can't do that for every new file I create. #MassiveFail #FixIt #GetADifferentPhone 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:49:58	Complaint	Performance Defect	Software	Upgrade	Operating System	Software		true

69776575	Love google products, but they are generally not user friendly and glitchy.Phone performs great, no hangups, great clarity... love the free features including the included inductive charging... BUTBattery life is mediocre at best, OS is nice but not intuitive (I think they are trying to avoid patent fights at the expense of use experience).The screenshot feature is HORRIBLE in this version (i had two previous nexuses).Positioning of the powr/volume buttons makes you press the wrong thing quite often.It is very fragile... I dropped it from 3 feet (car seat) and the back cracked -- reminds me of apple greed (repairs).All in all, an OK phone, especially for $300, but don't expect too much. For $600, what LG is selling it for, I'd be pissed. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:49:58	Complaint	Performance Defect	Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		true

65075753	I have been using smart phones since 2004 and owned Pre since the first week that it came out. Now after almost two months, I can't even think about living without this phone for one day. First two weeks I wasn't sure about my decision, but after couple of weeks I really started enjoying the phone. It takes a while to get used to it and learn how to use all the features of the phone. Also it takes a while to get used to the keyboard. It's not as good as blackberry keyboard, but I don't believe it's a fair comparison to  compare Pre's keyboard to Blackberry's, since form factors and sizes are so different. I have had zero problem with the phone, and it works flawlessly with my exchange account at work. If you are going to buy the phone, make sure to get the touchstone as well. It makes your life much easier. I have been using it both at home and in my car, and I love it. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:53:01	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

66523887	Update 8/5/13For whatever reason, I find myself unable to add the photos of the phone and box to the Amazon site - maybe whom-ever posted the page needed to allow it?Anyway - as someone asked, I thought I would post the frequencies used on the product:GSM/GPRS/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900UMTS/HSPA Bands  1/2/4/5/8(of which Data uses following bands 1(2100), 2(1900), 4(1700), 5(850), 8(900))Update 8/2/13I finally found the ZR on the Sony website, but it's on the sonymobile site.It arrived, had it for literally 5 mins - I will try ad post a couple of photos.Compared to the wifes Iphone 5, its a little larger - about a quarter inch in both directions, and a little thicker, but nice in the hand - doesn't feel much heavier.Screen is fantastic.I had a look at the waterproof doors and see the seal on inside the battery compartment.I didn't quite set the back on correctly the first time, so could see where someone thought it was fully engaged, but in fact wasn't.Sync'd up with my google accounts very quickly.Camera seems very good - can zoom in on a photo very far.-------------------------Initial reviewI have just ordered my ZR, having had a play with a friends phone. I was impressed enough to order my own. - I don't like to run with the crowd. - and thought it was a great alternative to the S4  Iphone.- He gets a lot of positive comments on it.(Sorry Amazon, you were a little more expensive than where I found it, even with the free prime shipping!)Based on another review here, I did some research first, and phoned Sony customer service to ask about the waterproofing.Yes, they do class it as waterproof, with the proviso that you keep the ports closed. - Which, I guess, is fair enough- I don't expect my car to keep water out in a storm if I leave the sunroof open!Taking that a step further, I asked about how I would return it if it did get water in it. - They take the phone back, and test it as is for water resistance with all the ports closed. - If it passes the test this way, then they make the assumption it was damaged while the ports were open. - if, on the other hand it fails that test, they replace the phone under warranty.I was also curious about Croma (I was looking to buy one, so as the other reviewer bought his there, I looked it up) - its an Indian company. - So not sure if the other reviewer is based in India, or just imported it from there. - Which might be another reason Sony USA wouldn't help?Anyway, looking forward to getting mine, especially having had preview of my friends, I will try and remember to do an update. 	sanarauf	11-02-2015 23:55:58	Complaint	Unable to Use	Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Internal Hardware		true

66477158	I think the previous reviews have echoed the pro and cons of this device. I love the large screen, HD1080p, Android OS and its multitude of apps, the security features for Enterprise usage, the ability to multitask like watching a movie and read emails or listen to streaming radio.My only con, and its a big one for me is that the placement of the volume control, in the middle of the left side of the device can interfere with basic usage. Every time I pick up the device using my left hand, I always end up pressing the volume control and max/min out the levels. I have tried various ways to handle the device and invariably, always press the volume. This is one annoying design flaw and wish they would have moved it to the top or on the right side of phone. I use this for work and was given to me so I did not choose this willingly. This is a a 5 star device but the volume control really knock two stars for me. This is the only phone I have #34;fought#34; with the volume control, whether its grabbing out of my pocket or picking off the desk. My solution may be to buy a folio cover.

23680717	I was switching from a samsung captivate to this phone. I had a terrible support experience with the samsung hardware and was hoping for a better experience overall with this phone. Unfortunately that was not to be.I like the overall look of the phone. Very attractive and also probably does not need a case as the black shell seems pretty robust. Also, on paper very impressive specs. However this looks to me like a very poor android implementation.In fact i now like the samsung captivate UI (gingerbread) much better than the HTC's jelly-bean based UI. Maybe its a personal choice, but some simple points to note: Samsung (as does apple) keeps all the app icons to a uniform size. The layout of the icons is very uniform. HTC appears extremely haphazard, not at all pleasing to the eye. The font on the HTC phone is also miserable. Comon, u have such a big screen, make use of it for the fonts. In spite of having such a big screen i have to strain myself a bit to read text anywhere in any context on this screen.I was initially happy that considering NVIDIA's reputation for heat, this phone did not heat up when i watched videos even for about an hour. However my happiness was shortlived with games. Within a few minutes of firing up the preinstalled game, the phone got very hot. Also, when i paired it via blutooth to my car's audio system, the phone got hot. And it got hotter AFTER i turned off bluetooth. And it stayed hotter even in my pocket after that. Another annoying thing is that if you play youtube with audio output thru bluetooth, there is a significant lag between the video and audio, about 4-5 seconds.Some of the fault is also from Android Jelly Bean. For all the hype about project butter and stuff, android manages to bring this quad-core 1.7Ghz phone to a crawl! Netflix just crawls on this latest and greatest OS from google. Specifically the netlflix app takes a long time to respond to touch inputs. The video playback itself is ok.Another problem is the phone size itself. It is not like i have small palms or such, but it is annoying to operate this phone with one hand (this is of course a common problem for all these big phones). I ended up dropping it a few times just while entering text.All in all, the poor font, the overheating problems didn't give me much confidence in this phone. I have since dumped this phone.Really i wish there was a phone with the same screen sizes as the previous gen (4-4.2inches) with the latest chipsets. I don't know why these manufacturers want to just go with bigger size. 	sanarauf	11-03-2015 00:10:45	Complaint		Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		true

66649762	This was purchased as a specific request for a relative. She needed a Blackberry under a certain amount of money and the Bold 9000 was the only thing other than the older Curve and Tour models available.It's difficult to leave a practical review for a phone released in 2008. It feels its age, really dated. We've come strides and I own a Nexus 4. That being said, I will try to be as objective as possible.Personally, I truly believe that she would have been wholly better off with a cheap Android or Windows phone vs. this device. It is pretty much stuck as it is. There is no update possible. 4.6 is the last OS version unless modding is involved (by that I mean there's no official update). The phone has ~45MB of free space, but at least there's an SD Card.It works well and it is quick, so to speak. I haven't really seen any lagging so far and calls are crisp and clear. It has a 2MP camera and is 3G capable. It is a quad band phone so it works with most GSM carriers.This is focussed at the seller.One thing that I didn't like is that the phone is advertised by BLUTEKUSA as new but is reconditioned. I've owned cell phones for 15+ years and by now can definitely tell between a brand new unboxing vs. opening up something that is refurbished. Also, and this is the kicker - I've opened up brand new bold 9000s before, as well as other BB devices. There's even a scuff mark on the battery and side of the phone. It didn't come with a manual or those booklets you always throw out because they're useless anyway, earphones, usb cable, etc. I got the phone, battery and charger cable - that's it. I'm considering returning it because I could just buy a phone advertised as refurbished for 1/2 the price from other vendors on Amazon. It's pretty dishonest. Amazon needs to change their policies in terms of how vendors advertise items as new vs. refurbished.Update: BLUTEKUSA contacted me asking me to remove my 3 star feedback (not this review) that I gave them to which I politely declined. It wasn't even negative, per se. I just put the facts. As I said in my response to them, sometimes you only get one chance to make a customer happy. This is one of those cases, there is no opportunity for a do-over. I was to send the phone to a relative abroad through a visiting family member. I had no chance to even source an alternative or replacement elsewhere much less from Blutekusa, so I have to stand by my feedback and I will now remove 1 star from my review here because the last thing you should do as a store is ask a customer to remove negative feedback. 	sanarauf	11-03-2015 00:17:05	Complaint	Performance Defect	Both	Replacement	Operating System	Enclosure		true
5800623	Awesome machine. However it's usability as a phone is limited. Blue tooth connects but in call voice quality blows chunks. Cannot hear the other person and make out only 3 or 4 words out of five.Battery could last a little longer.On the whole it's great. Hoping HTC fixes the blown out blue tooth in call quality but don't see it happening. I do read that rooting and installing other operating type stuff fixes this.Software update! Bluetooth call quality fixed! Solid 4.5 stars now, wish battery had more juice is only prob now 	sanarauf	11-03-2015 00:17:05	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		true
64520711	I have purchased three of these phones for my children and all three did not last more than a few months.  Each of the phones were dropped - either slipped out of someone's hand or fell out of a pocket when getting out of the car.  Every time the screen stopped working rendering the phone useless.  I stopped by a local ATT retail store to see if they could do anything for us - a rep gave the opinion that this is a common problem with these phones.  Unless you're accident free, you might consider another phone or one that can sit in a protective case.  Hope this helps! 	sanarauf	11-03-2015 00:17:05	Complaint	Unable to Use	Hardware	Replacement	Hardware	Display	caused	true

72752185	We bought this phone for travelling in Scotland.  When we arrived, it was simple and easy to buy a SIM card which provides the phone number.  It's very basic with minimal instructions but we were able to figure it out pretty quickly.  Texting is slow because the dialpad must be used but we used it to contact other friends in Scotland and it was not too cumbersome for the intended function.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a phone with bells and whistles that weren't needed for foriegn travel.  I would definitely suggest this product. Whatever provider you obtain a SIM card from, it's a simple process to be in communication economically. 	sanarauf	11-03-2015 00:21:15	Neutral	Performance Defect	Software	No Resolution Specified	Features	Software		true

49550905	I figured I would wait a while to review this phone. It is my first smartphone, though I had an iPod Touch before it. I was expecting it to be fast, and last a good amount of the day.The good:It looks absolutely brilliant. I love the design, and the phone feels so substantial. Friends often comment, even now, that my phone looks like it's new. The screen only has one or two scratches.The screen is beautiful. Images and videos are so crisp. And the brightness is great.It has 64gb of storage. I've so far used 15gb, and I love knowing I can store my whole music library on my phone.Their customer support seems excellent. I have only contacted them once, but I got a response THE SAME DAY! That's unheard of in customer support. The guy was really helpful too.The Bad:The battery life is abysmal. With 4g off, wifi on, and the screen on for about 1hr, my battery drops 40%. I did not expect anything amazing from the battery, but I thought it would be better than that. These are the results with #34;battery saver#34; on. With it off, the battery drains insanely fast.The speed. My friend's Droid Bionic is over 2 years old, and my quad core phone is choppier than his. We have tested this time and time again, and he beats my phone at simple tasks like opening and closing three programs quickly. Opening up chrome, opening up and sending a text. All simple functions I expect my phone to do without any lag. But there is always lag. In everything I do.Playing music is sometimes also an issue. Look around at forums and you will find this problem. Basically the audio gets really jittery and cuts out. When this happens, the whole phone becomes unusable for 5-20 seconds. The screen doesn't turn on, or if you are using the phone, it will freeze. This problem is rare, but it always seems to strike when I need to use my phone for something urgent.It heats up very quickly. Everyone I've lent my phone to tells me it is way too hot. I don't have to do much for it to heat up. Simple operations like playing music or browsing reddit will cause this. When GPS is on, the issue is exascerbated, but that is to be expected. What's unexpected is how hot it gets from just calling or texting. Two things that are not intensive at all.All in all, I would have given this phone 3 stars had it not been for the lag. That is completely unacceptable, and ruins the experience of having a portable work station. 	sanarauf	11-03-2015 00:25:19	Comparison		Both	No Resolution Specified	Operating System	Enclosure		true

69274284	I'm not technically inclined and after reading countless reviews, I purchased my first smartphone and selected the HTC Windows 8x phone (T-mobile).  Being a Hotmail user, the phone was super-easy to sync with my Hotmail contacts, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  I'm not a listen-to-music-or-videos-on-my-phone kind of person, so the limited storage doesn't bother me.  For what I want it to do (primarily texting and social media), the phone is simple to use, and after a week of use, I absolutely adore it!The only thing I don't care for is the battery life. I'd read reviews that it wasn't good, but it is terrible.  I'm a heavy texter and use social media throughout the day, but still....I'd expected a fully-charged battery to last longer than 12 hours, which is typically when I need to plug the phone says battery is critcally low and I need to charge it.Otherwise, I'm very impressed with this phone and love it!! 	sanarauf	11-03-2015 00:27:08	Compliment	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect	No Defect		true

64509465	TL: DR: awesome phone, I enjoy WP8 platform, I question how #34;new#34; this phone was when I received itI really enjoy this phone. For reference I've had an iPhone before making the switch to a Samsung Focus Windows phone, and then replaced that with the Nokia 920.***The pluses for Windows Phone 8***+ Live tiles are great and give loads of info at a glance. I considered getting a new iPhone or Android phone but the lack of a Live Tile analog killed that idea. I've come to depend on them. Basically each app icon is a tile, occupying space on the main screen. Those tiles display bite sized bits of info so you don't have to open the program to see new info. For example, new emails show the first couple sentences, meeting info shows up on your calendar tile, etc+ Great phone for business users - MS Office integration, Live Tiles+ Cool xbox live integration+ Good social integration if you are into that. A continuous feed of Facebook/Linked in updates in one place+ Tile UI is cleaner, more usable than the iphone/android phones I've compared. I liken those UI's to a desktop computer cluttered with shortcut icons.+ Separate inboxes for all my email accounts***The Minuses for Windows Phone 8***- The marketplace is not nearly as robust as the iPhone or Android market. However if you are like me, you only use 1% of the stuff you download - the important stuff - and that is fully represented on the marketplace.***Pluses for the Lumia 920***+ Feels sturdy. Looks big and bulky to carry in pocket, but I don't notice it when I do.+ Beautiful display. This was a standout for me in the ATT store doing comparisons with other phones.+ Stunning night pictures - this aspect of the camera really impressed me. Very high detail photos+ Runs fast - apps open fast+ Decent battery life. I'm a heavy user and I can usually get away with charging it when I get home at night and having a day's charge the next day.+ Gorilla glass prevents most scratches+ Good call quality+ Speakerphone is pretty good, but volume perhaps a little low+ Infinitely better than the Samsung Focus I had.***Minuses for the Lumia 920***- The Nokia Drive app (think Google maps navigation) is really hit and miss sometimes.- Day shots with the camera can look blurry on occasion- I never had a protective case - dropped it many times without issue - but one drop smashed the entire display. But like I said, I did not use a protective case.AS FOR THIS SELLER: I have to question how *new* this phone was when I received it. This is actually my second 920 since my cat knocked mine off the table, hitting it just right and smashing the display. I was searching for a way to get a new phone without paying a ridiculous amount of $$$ since I was not ready for upgrade discount. When I pulled the laminate off the screen I noticed a number of very small micro-scratches. A brand new factory-sealed phone would not have these scratches. I wonder if this was a used phone that could pass for new, and then someone cleaned it up for resale. I'm speculating here, but the micro-scratches seem suspicious to me. But I did get this far below what my carrier would charge me.My advice, get the phone, but buyer beware when using this seller. 	sanarauf	11-03-2015 00:27:08	Comparison		Hardware	No Resolution Specified	Hardware	Internal Hardware		true
