22994140	This can pop 3-1/2 nails into glued beams with a Dewalt twin hotdog compressor. That should be enough info right there.It comes with a bump or pull trigger combo which is nice. You can rotate where the air blasts out, which is really nice so you don't get air-tool oil in your mouth.I've made two garages, a 18'x9', x20' tall green house, a chicken coup, and a few curtain walls. It pretty much pays for itself the first building you build because you save so much time. You really need the angle on the nail feed, helps get into places.Air gun nails are really good, because they are banded together with glue, so when the nail gets driven in, they get glued at the same time.You can use it without putting air tool oil in the air intake, but if you want it to hold up for a couple decades, there is a lot of friction in air tools, and oil reduces the friction, which reduces general wear and tear.All framing guns are built nearly identically. Most builders have their preference but it really comes down to little aesthetics like adjustable air release, trigger types, belt hooks, etc.Currently all my air-tools are porter cable. I have their pin nailer, brad nailer, finish nailer, stapler, and framing gun. If I use the correct pressure setting on my compressor, nails drive in every time. Even when my tiny compressor is catching up. I do not like the recoil of the auto-bump.. I tend to double bump when I push down. Not really a big deal. I'm not a pro-framer. One trigger pull, one nail is fast enough for me.I just ordered a Bosch framing gun. They just started a line after 4 years of research into full force technology apparently. It vents out the front. I haven't used that yet, but that's basically the only framing gun that isn't a standard build. It's about $100 more expensive though. I got it only because it was used, and for the right price. 	muellerp	10-17-2015 22:36:06	Performance Defect			Yes		false
34005336	I have a rolodex, I'm old fashioned and I do not have my contacts in my smartphone. I needed more blanks but was a little disappointed in how thin/papery these cards are. 	muellerp	10-17-2015 22:36:06	Performance Defect			Yes		false
27720586	This drill is fantistic.  It weighs about the same as my old 9.6 volt drill, but has much more power.  The balance is good and the chuck is exceptional.  It is perfect for the do-it-yourselfer and for moderate sized projects.  I am using it to install new deck boards on a dock and it is doing a great job.  If you have a really large project, you may want to purchase the larger batteries that are available from Makita, but for most projects the 1.5 AH batteries are all you need.  Recharge time is quick, so if you have 110 volt power available at the job site you don't really need larger bateries. 	muellerp	10-17-2015 22:36:06	No Defect			No		false
30155750	This compressor works well and does the things I want it to do. It is easy to move around to good locations. I am not a contractor, so I don't know how it would perform under more extreme use. 	muellerp	10-17-2015 22:36:06	No Defect			No		false
57836451	I ONLY USED THIS SAW ONCE AND IT WAS NOT BAD. IT SURE HAS PLENTY OF POWER. ITS A LITTLE HARD TO SEE THE BLADE WHILE YOUR CUTTING. I HAD A BLACK  DECKER SAW JUST LIKE THIS ONE AND IT FINALLY DIE AFTER MANY, MANY USES OVER THE PASED 15 YEARS. THIS ONE IS JUST AS GOOD. 	muellerp	10-17-2015 22:36:06	Safety Defect			Yes		false
42978601	It worked great (4 stars) for a week! Then it died. Tried to turn it on one day and nothing. Was working fine the evening before, nothing obvious is wrong with it.Even more disappointing, I have no been able to get in touch with the seller/manufacturer for an exchange.... Very disappointed. 	muellerp	10-18-2015 02:12:16	Performance Defect			Yes	Poor customer service	false
51748812	I've used this twice, and really, for the price, it's a nifty little tool. I had originally looked at the peticure, but read reviews about the battery not lasting long, plus it costs twice as much. Thought I'd try this and it works great-especially if using rechargeable batteries. I know I didn't want a cord, and the batteries in a rechargeable unit will eventually wear out. This is great-if it runs down, you can pop in charged batteries and it keeps going.I'm sure you can pay twice as much and get a better unit, but at least for me and my little chihuahua/terrier, this one does the job. 	muellerp	10-18-2015 02:12:16	No Defect			No		false
36106483	I've been using this little router for some 20 years now and it is my go-tool for any most of my routing tasks.  I have half a dozen routers in the shop, including some very expensive and precision units, but this little guy is so handy that unless I need super stability or precision micro-adjustments, I grab this one.  It has done miles of laminate and counter-edge trimming of oak and other hardwoods, and after probably hundreds of hours of use it is still running as new.Is it perfect?  No.  The height adjustment is at best, primitive.  I've just learned how to set its depth-of-cut with minimum follow-up corrections.  The nut that is supposed to secure the base to the body needs to be tightened with pliers, since hand tightening is just not enough to prevent it from loosening and then moving during a cut.  My trimmer came with the full laminate-trimming kit in a nice steel carrying case, and back when laminate counter tops were still acceptable in kitchens, this kit was great.I routinely abuse this little machine by doing long 12#8221; radius roundovers on long beams and such, and it has never overheated or shown any signs of stress. I like the fact that it has a shaft-lock so that only one wrench is required to change bits.  The button is not very well placed, however, and I seem to hit it occasionally during use.  No damage has resulted, but it makes a lot of noise and is no doubt not good for the tool.  Also, the power switch is not placed well, as it is a two-handed operation to shut the machine off.Bottom line:  After more than 20 years of use, I'd replace this tool with another just like it. 	muellerp	10-18-2015 02:12:16	Performance Defect			Yes		false
22092424	Great product!  Highly recommended.  Very low profile so easy to carry and stow away.  The power of the suction is excellent.  Will never try to go back to any kind of hand-held vacuum. 	muellerp	10-18-2015 02:12:16	No Defect			No		false
58630303	This is an amazing sander.  I Build custom furniture (mostly tables) and after much reading I decided to buy this sander and I'm glad I did.  I actually haven't sanded anything with it yet other than some testing I've done with it.  But what I have done has shown me that this is a very effective sander with almost no vibration on the highest setting.  If you run it on a lower speed there is some vibration but as you turn the speed up the vibration lessens and almost disappears on it's highest setting.  It's very smooth and can be easily controlled with one hand.  Ive only tested it with 120 grit so far but the material removal seems great, and I also got no swirl marks.  This is a professional tool for sure.  But it should be for 230 dollars.  I'm really starting to become a fan of Bosch toolsMy only complaint is not with the tool itself but with amazon.  My sander appears to have been used before.  The pad was in excellent condition (brand new) and the tool itself seems fine.  But it definitely had been out of the box before.  There was a gray scuff on the white part of the pad, and the body of the the sander had some marks on it that I had to wipe off, but the dead give away was the tiny lint all over the black rubber grips on the tool which indicated someone had used the tool and then cleaned it up.  There appears to be nothing wrong with it and I don't feel like waiting 2 weeks to get a replacement so I'm going to keep it but I wanted to warn others.  I've read other reviews where people complain about things like this.  I would say if you could buy this locally then do so.  You just don't know what you're going to get with amazon.  I ordered a set of bailey chisels a couple weeks ago and they arrived scattered all over the place lose in the box.  Thankfully the edge guards stayed on them and there was no damage to any of them.  But I really can't rate amazon's service very high because their shipping department sucks and they sell privously used tools before properly cleaning them for resale. 	muellerp	10-18-2015 02:12:16	No Defect			No	Overall no product defect, but there was a complaint with the overall service from Amazon.  Product works great and is safe.	false
51242116	I#8217;ve used enough different sanders over the decades but Metabo SXE400 is definitely best small sander in my experience. Proprietary vacuum hose (31 592) and 2 #8221;adaptor (63 0316) took some searching to locate distributor, though pads are found on Amazon. All were worth the trouble and cost. 	muellerp	10-18-2015 17:16:27	No Defect			No	Tough to locate product, and should really look into making easier to find.	false
24937457	Good clear instructions on adjusting sensitivity.Easy to put up, works great has now lasted for 6 months with no problems.other brands I've bought, the sensor goes out. this one is good.low beam just right at nite to see backyard, any motion and it lights right up real bright. 	muellerp	10-18-2015 17:18:16	No Defect			No		false

58586055	My son and i have been sharing the predecessor to this 1590 EVSL for about 25 years and we loved it but now that we are living in different parts of the world he needed his own, so finding this was incredible due to the fact that almost no one likes the new replacement model that Bosch has designed. My son tells me that it is even better than our old one, real solid, cuts so clean for all of the perfectionist work that we use it for. Thank you forever. 	muellerp	10-18-2015 17:33:05	No Defect			No		false

29430670	First things first: If you're a pro, or a serious woodworker looking for a tool to use every day- or even every week- this ain't the one. It doesn't have the muscle to drive 50 screws deep into wood, or to drill steel, or any of a dozen other things you might want a good cordless drill motor for.But that's not what I bought it for. I've got a good Makita 1/2 cordless, and a couple of corded drills for that. This was for my girlfriend, who needs a drill once in a blue moon, and would like an electric screw driver for regular tasks around the house. And for that kind of use, it's very good indeed.So if you're looking for a convenient drill for light duty use, the BD; 9.6v is not a bad choice. One hint: The wall wart charger takes a long time to bring the drill up to full charge, so if you're thinking of regular use, get the fast charger and a second battery. 	muellerp	10-18-2015 18:15:05	Performance Defect			Yes	Poor performance because people trying to do serous wood work it is not going to work.  For everyday house use it may, but even then battery is poor.	false
37336056	This is absolutely necessary to overhaul a Chrysler 8-1/4 or 9-1/4 rear end. You can make one if you have a welder, otherwise you will need this or similar to loosen the differential bearing adjusters inside the housing through the axle tube. Pretty much useless for anything else, but you save yourself a $G-note by doing the work yourself. The only other 'special' tools you absolutely need is a 0-60 inch/lbs dial or beam type torque wrench to check the critical pinion bearing preload, and a dial indicator to check the ring gear backlash. Not any easy job by any stretch... but well within the capability of an experienced home mechanic. Make sure you have a factory manual for procedure. 	muellerp	10-18-2015 18:17:25	No Defect			No		false
46667160	I'm at the tail end of a long remodel project, and only just now picked one of these units up at my local HD after many hundreds of screws driven with various Ryobi and Milwaukee drill/driver tools.I've been doing it wrong!This impact driver is loud but fast, nearly instantly sinking 1-1/4 inch screws with no pop out of the driver bit from the screw head.This 18v Ryobi tool has about the same compact footprint as my M12 Mikwaukee drill/drivers, though not as compact as either brand's close quarter / right angle drills.It's also probably not the best choice for any fasteners requiring finesse or a light touch. This tool is designed to SINK SCREWS.Be warned that if you by the Ryobi combo kit, the P236 (this model) IS NOT the model that you'll get. This one has a 3-LED headlight and I believe either marginally higher RPM or BPM or torque, I don't recall which, but compare the figures on the retail boxes (probably info also available on Ryobi or HD's websites) -- as best I can tell, the P236 is available as tool only.As much as I wish I had started off years ago with something other than the Ryobi 18v brand, I'm pretty much roped in to it with a large collection of their tools, batteries and chargers, and honestly, I've been very pleased with the service life it's all given me. This impact driver seems to be no exception. 	muellerp	10-18-2015 18:20:20	No Defect			No		false

37826122	I have received this Drill-Driver and while the tool itself is apparently a fine useful thing, there is NO DRILL CHUCK included. This makes it ONLY useful as a DRIVER in the state you get it as purchased. The item that you order, which I ordered, is delivered with NO DRILL usefulness because there is NO DRILL chuck included to allow the possibility of drilling anything. It comes out of the box set up very well for driving Phillips head screws. It has two batteries and a charger, and the battery in the tool when you remove it from the included belt holster is charged. But there is no more. Drive sheetrock screws, case screws, escutcheon screws, any screw that can be driven by a quarter inch hex drive collet. NOTHING ELSE. There are several drill chucks available that will fit into the supplied hexagonal collet that is the only drive option available with this otherwise excellent portable power tool. 	rgruss	10-18-2015 19:45:17	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

40019324	I am in the custom home systems integration business.  This saw is one of the best, if not the best tool in my van.  A Sawsall is great for bigger jobs, but for cutting speakers holes or outlet boxes into drywall this is the best.  (A RotoZip makes too much dust and is hard to control.) Drywall dust from cutting ceiling speaker holes eats them up and I have to change the grease 3 or 4 time to extend the life of the saw, but I still buy them.  I used to get them for $75.  Now they are twice that.  It could be because I think they are or will be discontinued soon.  Nothing out there like it.  I hope my order goes through for 1 more. 	rgruss	10-19-2015 17:01:34	No Defect		Expert	No		true
37415458	Couldn't believe the delivery time was like 2 days. This unit was a little more than other units but is really well made. The plastic grills are really heavy duty. Was going to order the Grizzly but after shipping, extra large cost, and believe it or not TAX, it was more than this unit. It is extremely quiet. Have it in my two car garage and can feel the circulation on medium and see the dust traveling towards it. Would definitely buy it again. As others have said all units probably work about the same as they are a box with a fan and filters. The Powermatic looked to have a larger motor, so I went with it. 	rgruss	10-19-2015 17:01:34	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
23009778	After reading 2 reviews here and because of the price I purchased this 3 in 1 sander. As stated by another review it came with no paperwork but not to worry, i sent an email to Palmgren and the next day I received a reply with an attachment for the 28 page manual. The difference in price between what competitors sell this for and what it costs here makes it MORE than worth the hastle of emailing Palmgren for the manual. I am happy I bought it here! It is a good quality machine for the money.T. MercerColorado 	rgruss	10-19-2015 17:01:34	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

51963181	I have used this on several house remodels. It has been very reliable and powerful. I use it on occasional basis and have shot about 7000 nails out of it (about 100 a day). I use grip rite nails. Like the full head nails. Sometimes follow up with hammer if pressure too low.(about 95 lbs...)And prefer the 3 1/4 inch.  One helper(novice) loaded nails in wrong and was able to shoot nail out thru the frame.(lower angle). Unjammed the gun and kept going strong. 	rgruss	10-19-2015 17:03:06	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

46300247	This unit is precisely what I wanted as I have a small job in my laundry room that will require new drywall.

40393336	Upon reading all the reviews on this both good and bad, it is a mediocre product. I picked mine up from a woodworking store 5 or 6 years ago and had no issues with packaging and assembling per everyone elses problems. My issues were the lever would bind half way down while trying to drill through and once I started drilling it was rather tough going. After many mortises the piece where the lever connected to the motor broke into pieces and it did take quite a while to get a replacement. I do agree that the hp is not quite enough for drilling through hard woods like maple or oak. Many mortises have been made since my purchase but I just deal with with the binding...you get what you pay for I guess. 	rgruss	10-19-2015 17:04:34	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		true
25078943	If it were not for the problems it has with the variable speed switch this would be a wonderful tool for small jobs.  I was very happy with it for about two years of infrequent use. I didn't use it all that often but when I did it was invaluable.  But then the speed switch stop varying the speed.  It would either be off or at maximum speed.  After doing a little research I found out that this is not an uncommon problem with this model.  If it were not for this I would be giving it 5 stars.  Since most jobs need a slower speed it has become rather useless to me now. 	rgruss	10-19-2015 17:04:34	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
44914255	I had reservations about the light feature until I found out how bright it is and that it stays on for a while. I have even taken to just using it instead of carrying a flashlight too. There is also a glow in the dark ring that helps you find the impact driver in the dark. Sounds a little silly until you find out that the light is attached to something that can drive a 12 lag screw into a glu-lam with ease. It is also small enough to fit in tight quarters and light enough to use all day without causing the tennis elbow I was getting from my 18 volt Porter Cable hammer drill. Just getting the impact driver and charger was worth the cost but the drill is a nice bonus. 	rgruss	10-19-2015 17:04:34	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

45980894	I recently purchased, a JBM 5, this is a very easy tool to set up and use, and does do accurate and quite reproducible work.  There is one large problem.  There is a mismatch between the chuck and the 1/2 inch chisel bit combo.  Jet disclosed to me, after I could not insert the 1/2 inch bit as far into the chuck as was necessry to work with the chisel, that there is a mismatch between the bits and the chucks, and some machines got the wrong chuck for the bit.  Very unfortunately, they offered me no fix, other than to cut down the drill shank enough that it would fit in the chuck and not stick out of the chisel.  I found this quite suprising. 	rgruss	10-19-2015 17:06:40	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true

36153823	I own an electrical contracting business that has dozens of cordless drills that are used every day. This drill by far has proven to be the best overall. I also have many  center grip dewalt drills that I would say are so so. The chuck in this model is 2nd to none. If you are a contractor spend the extra money and purchase this model. The only downfall I see is that it doesn't come with lithium batteries which I have changed over several of our service trucks with. 	trangp	10-19-2015 18:04:22	No Defect		Expert	No		false
32533646	For what it counts I am a struggling self taught(with mistakes)garage woodworker who is space and financially challenged.  Overall this is a great little product for casual woodworking.  If you are a full timer using highend wood then you should probably spend some cash for highend machine.  I have used the joiner and planer with good results, now my friends keep showing up wanting me to machine their wood(from a tree).The reviews are correct, the users manual and the hardware you receive does not match...not to worry just look at the picture and hardware and you will figure it out.  Setting the planer out feed table is fun but doable, just leave the three attaching bolts loose before you use the two allen head screws to set the outfeed table a little higher at the outside edge.  The inside edge should be flush where it attaches. I spent more time adjusting everything than I did assembling it.  I did not have a coplanar issue as some have reported.  I did have to learn what coplanar was and no I feel like einstein.My only dislikes are the cheap plastic locks and that the back fence is not adjustable, just use a sacrifical fence so you are not always joining over the same area of the knives.

I have never had a major problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable, which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers. The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place, ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice. I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own. None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors. On one of my machines, the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape. Aside from that, the unit collects and pushes dust away properly. I would still suggest using a mask, however. 	trangp	10-19-2015 18:18:41	No Defect		Expert	No		false

Compatibility: RotoSaw is compatible with all RotoZip accessories expanding its versatility4. Collet Lock: Is easy to access, allows for quick accessory change5. Variable Speed: Provides more tool controlAs one reviewer wrote, this is truly a hand-sized tool on steroids.  You will need a guide to cut straight in thicker material as you will most certainly need to go around the material instead of right through it.

40767667	As a small fellow, I bought this primarily because it was so light.  It is certainly easier to handle.  However, you do have to hold it strongly with both hands.  It develops so much torque and has so little mass to resist, kickback is definitely more of a problem than with my old Sears Craftsman.  I've experienced it climbing up the workpiece and running backwards across it, particularly with a narrow kerf blade like that intended for plywood.That said, if held securely, it's a very good saw.

33335813	I have been using a 30+ year old, inherited, Bridgewood (now Grizzly) shaper for 10 years. Halfway through building two grandfather clocks, I needed a shaper that was more versatile and efficient. I found everything I wanted in the Powermatic PM2700, and more. Although I needed to have a  solitary 40 amp circuit installed, it was worth it. The 5 hp motor never hesitates or bogs down during the heaviest cuts. The digital readout is highly accurate and allows me to duplicate depth of cuts from one piece to another with ease.  Cutter changing is a breeze, and the very large top surface of the shaper provides ample room to move around the machined during template cuts. One of my favorite features is that both fences move together, but either one can be finely adjusted independently. The cutter guard is clear and provides a safe and easy way to observe the cutter in action.Most of the tools in my shop are from Powermatic. I have never been disappointed in the quality of any of the PM machines (8 #34; jointer, 15#34; thickness planer, PM2000 cabinet saw, drill press). The need for a rare question to the technical support has been met with expert and patient advice.I highly recommend the PM 2700 to anyone who is interested in a heavy duty, accurate, and professional shaper. 	trangp	10-19-2015 18:20:33	No Defect		Expert	No		false
29686474	I really like this drill's features and power, and the weight is not a problem with me either. My problem is with the chuck that wobbles. I use one of these drills at my job so I wanted one for my own use at home. I thought I bent the drill at work until I bought one for myself two weeks ago. It wobbled right out of the box. I took it back and the other one did the same. I am taking it back and have since ordered a Milwaukee 0524-24 18 volt. I could only recommend this drill if DeWalt comes to their senses and fixes what is obviously not an isolated problem.

54647045	I do a fair amount of repair of scientific equipment. Manufacturers build their instruments to last forever, and use some sort of thread locking material on every stinking nut and bolt they install.  Often I have limited space to work, and I can only schlep around so many tools at once.The Milwaukee M12 Cordless 12V 3/8 Impact Tool is an excellent example of the progression and application of lithium ion technology, creating super-strong and super small-tools, that entered the market three to four years ago. My overall impression is that this impact driver fits a niche that other manufacturers have seemingly overlooked.I use a variety of cordless compact LiIon impact driver tools.  In reading the accompanying review of the Milwaukee 3/8 M12 Impact Driver, I was concerned about the reviewer's critique of the tool's wimpy torque factor, as in inch/pounds (in/lbs) rating.  The reviewer expressed how underwhelmed he was when trying out the 2451-20.  For reference, I first looked at the advertised in/lbs rating of the Bosch 12V Max LiIon Impactor, and the manufacturer states a maximum rating of 800 inch/lbs of torque. I then checked the same factor for the Milwaukee 2451-20 and Milwaukee claims a maximum torque of 1000 in/lbs, which would suggest 20% more torque than the Bosch Impactor.I suppose there is some sort of graphic curve one can refer to or plot out as to what the maximum torque force one could elicit using a 12V LiIon cell and motor. It would be the same old argument about how many horsepower (hp) one can get our of a motor wired to 110V.  I suppose through mechanical leverage, a manufacturer might be able to reduce friction and inefficiency, but folks, 12 volts is only 12 volts!So, having several M12 tools such as he mini Hacksall, the right angle drill, copper tube cutter, the M12 radio and several of the M12 flashlights, batteries and chargers, including the cool dual voltage 110V/12V model, I opted for a bare Milwaukee 2451-20. I also purchased the 3/8 to 1/4 driver adapter so I could use my collection of 1/4 hex bits too.  I rounded out my Milwaukee purchase with the Milwaukee 3/8 deep socket set. Without a doubt, I am very pleased with my investment and would heartly refer my friends and co-workers to purchase the same product.I am a HUGE fan of Bosch tools.  Having said that, I'd like to point out the single competitive advantage that the Milwaukee 2451-20 3/8 M12 driver has over the Bosch 12V Max Impactor, is the fact that there is more metal used to build the square drive socket holder. I have broken so many bits, nutdrivers and adapters with the Bosch Impactor, because I am asking an awesome tool to do a big job with a bit that has a 1/4 hex shank.In summary, because there does not appear to be a viable alternative at this time in the compact 3/8 12V LiIon impact driver realm, I believe Milwaukee offers a unique utility tool. Milwaukee by all accounts has decided to invest heavily developing other novel tools with the same 12V battery platform, and this one is a beauty, eh? Plus, 20% more torque,so says Milwaukee.I love it. 	trangp	10-19-2015 18:25:32	No Defect		Expert	No		false

That's after around twenty years.I wish it had a slot for the spare tip, but almost all screws are Phillips nowadays; very few are straight anymore.I have bought the best AAs I can find and have them ready.

41095615	First realize this product is a kit, not a finished assembled product!!  That said, my kit I got arrived in quite good shape.  Understanding that it is a collection of thin metal pannels,and other hardware, and perhaps a million small nuts bolts and washers.  The actual product box was inclosed in an outer shipping box.  Perhaps the model that I recieved was updated because it appears as though there was considerable packaging effort to get it to me safe.  There was even plate glass for the window that made it to me unscathed!  One or two of the pannels were a bit damaged.Next important point....  It is NOT a one man job to assemble!!!! so dont even try to do this solo.  I am mechanically inclined and I work on cylinder heads as a hobby but still putting this thing together was daunting.Third.  It will take several hours. But is it well worth it to invest the time to build it right the first time. Tighten those fastners like you dont ever want to have to touch them again.Fourth.  Follow another reviewer's advice and seal up the seams with caulk.  My kit came with rolls of adhesive foam strip seals but this is easily damaged when putting together the main chamber.There was a fault in the gun supplied with my kit but after a thorough inspection, I saw the bit of metal left from machinin the gun which was blocking the media passage into the air stream.  I got rid of that and the unit worked fine with some medium grit black beauty that I got.So why did I give this four stars? In a word, price!  For the price I think its well worth it.  Once you get it together, and get it sealed it does the job it was designed to do perfectly.  The only reason I would pay 100 bucks more for a simmilar cabinet was if it came assembled... that is the only thing that would justify the price.I also appreciate the fact that the unit came with an assortment of ceramic nozels and several replacement plastic sheilds for the viewing screen.  I've made some mods so that it functions better for me.  This included longer hoses for the gun, both for the media feed and for the air.  I find I also need more light inside of the cabinet.I'm pleased with the product. 	trangp	10-19-2015 18:27:32	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

27760005	I got one of these yesterday and immediately took it back. I am a woodworker by hobby and needed to do particular sanding. I found the packaging excellent, but that's where it stops. Yes it sands. The verticle plate in back of the 1quot; belt was 1/4 inch to the left and cannot be adjusted. It was also bent back 15 degrees and not flush to the belt. The throat is not deep, so, sanding a part of a piece of wood longer that a 10 inches cannot be done. Metal parts were jagged and dangerous, especially the little tables. The miter gauge with the disk sander table is small and wobbled in the miter slot and therefore useless for any specific angle of cut. All in all a very cheesy product. If a straight line or a 90 degree angle is of any interest to a user, leave this product on the shelf. 	trangp	10-19-2015 18:29:24	Safety Defect		Expert	Yes	safety defect because of the jagged metal parts	false

56699938	All I can say is that this particular tool has come in REAL handy in the month that I've owned it. From cutting through wood with nails (deck expansion) to cutting off LARGE branches from a tree(s) that fell in my yard after a storm (and onto my car!), this tool has been used extensively.The battery life of the 3 amp hour lithium ion battery is amazing! The durability of the saw is impressive in that most of the environments I've used it in have been dirty and wet, yet the saw works like it did when it was new. Only it's transformer looks now have blended in with the dirt.I actually like the looks of the drill in that conveys that the tool can wreck some damage!

43386555	This folding table set is an essential accessory for the DeWalt 735 planer. Without it it is really difficult to feed the boards straight into the planer, avoiding the snipe (uneven finish at the front and back edge of the board being planed).The build quality is high, installation easy. Make sure you adjust the tables after installation to be exactly level with the planer's table. This is easily done (see instructions enclosed w. the accessory).In principle you could build a wooden in-feed / outfeed table yourself, but it would be difficult to make it exactly co-planar with the planer's table, and it would probably cost more than this product.Sometimes the planer actually comes as a package with these tables and spare set of knives (check prices).Amazon delivered the product quickly.

51439785	I have a couple of impact drivers, and they are older, they are far from ancient, but compared to dewalt, the Greenworks is a monster! The G24 has more torque than you will likely need. I mean, even when testing it out,before I started driving screws, I could feelthe torque and itactually is so strong that I have to figth the rotation. You just have to be careful that youdon't over do it. The drill is a little heavy, heavier than my Dewalt. But comparing the two, GreenWorks is much more powerful. Battery life is good, and it charges normally, not super fast, not super slow. There is a little bit of an odor when you start using it at first, but that goes away. I was not thinkingof starting up my garage project, but guess what.....I did. Sheetrock up, supports and header done. Door put up.Now working on the rafters for some extra storage. Next will be repairing a wall. Sweet! I am very glad I got this. My favorite (for a long time) was my Panasonic, but now I am newborn and a full GreenWorks fan. I like the case it comes with. Keeps it clean, neat and organized. If you are looking for a solid impact drive with lots of torque, look no further!

34673696	I use the rest of the VPX line all the time, and really like most of them. But I agree with earlier reviewers that this driver badly needed either a variable-speed trigger or a clutch. It kept trying to yank itself out of my hand when the screws bottomed out.I ended up with a Dremel Driver, with a variable-speed trigger, that I like much better. The only drawback is that the battery is internal, instead of being changeable.

It beats me why anyone would want to roll the dice on this device when a reliable alternative (i.e., pneumatic nail gun) is available.  With such a high number of defective guns sold already, has there been a product liability class action of any sort initiated yet?

62272716	I recently bought this saw and must say it is amazing.  You can cut indoors!!  I am a contractor (15 yrs in business) specializing in bathrooms and must cut tiles in cold temps in winter. if you have experienced in wet saws you know they can make quite the mess when you cut indoors in a basement and tend to freeze over while cutting outdoors in cold temps.  This saw has almost no spray off.  The water is shot down the tray and picked up by the blade from under the tile.  They also have a more traditional spray directly on the blade from under the blade guard that is volume adjustable to give you only the amount of water you need.  I just tiled a 10' tall 4'x5' custom standing shower, 100sqft. floor, and tub deck and surround indoors with very little clean up.  It is very light weight and so far i haven't even see the motor overload safety led light even flicker.  I have been using a pearl abrasive saw for over ten years( also a great saw) and was amazed how much lighter this saw is than my old one.  I can't speak to the longevity of the saw but it cuts straight and is very innovative.  Only complaint is that there should be a better system of running the hoses to saw from pump.  The lines kinda get bunched up in the water tray. I bought the saw locally so no comment on shipping, and as far as setup goes it took me and my crew about 25min from box to up and running. great saw for professionals, probably too much saw for your average homeowner. I hope it lasts as long as my pearl abrasive. 	trangp	10-19-2015 18:39:48	No Defect		Expert	No		false

39989712	I got this drill for small jobs and for use in tight spaces. It is also great for working where I have to reach far away from my body  where a normal size drill would be difficult to hold steady.  The only problem I have with it  is that the chuck does not grip a small drill well and if drilling into a 2x4 the drill slips in the chuck before penetrating the board Thus the 4 star ratiing and if the chu;ck held better it would get a 5 star rating by me. 	trangp	10-19-2015 18:40:57	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes	problem with the grip a defect?	false

I made an adapter to connect it to my shopvac, and that worked good, but it's a little bit of a hassle dragging the hose around. Now I've just been using the bag by itself and it's been working just fine for me. What I've found is that all I need to do is to give it a second or two to come up to speed, which will fill the bag with air, before I make my cut, then the cuttings all go into the bag.

They could go as far as adding other items as suggestions i.e. table mobile bases, dado inserts, etc.As for the fence, I agree with the great majority, I had to play with it.  I was about to buy a new fence but I decided to call the Jet tech support and they gave me some ideas in how to correct my erros.  Am I 100% satisfy? I will say I am 1/16quot; off in my adjustment.

57294253	Works well enough for someone who will not need a rugged or precise tool.

I got my planer in pretty good shape except for a broken plastic cover. Then when I called DeWalt they gave me a number to call my nearest service center. I've bought DeWalt before and I'm kind of disappointed with them on this one. Still a decent price for a good planer just have to go through a little more trouble for it. I am happy with the planer itself. I just don't understand why Dewalt won't spend some extra money on packaging rather than extra parts and additional shipping of those parts.

45887742	I am a plumber and am used to cutting my PVC pipe w/ a good o'l cordless Sawzaw.  Thought I'd give this tool a shot to save me from cleaning up the shavings and cutting perfectly straight.  I just used the tool for the second time on a repair and the tool cut great on the first cut but on the second cut it basically shattered the 2 PVC Foam Core. Mind you I was in a tight place on the second cut and couldn't give the tool a little twist as I was beginning the cut. Ended up using the Sawzaw to clean up the mess. Also, the safety is cumbersome especially when switching from cut to retract which mind you does not happen automatically.  You must power the shear open for a sec. before you can hit the quick release lever. It's probably good that the safety is a pain, otherwise the tool would be very dangerous.  But if you did start to cut into an appendage, you would have to switch it to reverse, push the safety, then drop the tool and call 911.  I think I would like the tool better if it defaulted to the open position at all times when you release the trigger. I would give it all five stars if it didn't shatter my PVC pipe.  Other than that it does cut a perfectly clean and straight cut so maybe use it when roughing in or when shattering pipe isn't such a problem like in a repair situation were you kinda need to be left with some usable pipe to make the connections proper. 	trangp	10-19-2015 19:35:43	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes	It seems to have a performance defect and also a safety defect	false

85769849	I received the Max Gyro as a gift for my birthday and liked it so much I bought one for all my friends.  Intuitive use makes it easy to use one hand and it is much lighter than any cordless drill used as a screwdriver.  I am satisfied with the torque and the LED light makes it easy to find screws in dark crevices.  I have used in building three sets of shelves and permanent wooden baby gates for the bar in our house and have been very happy to have it.The only drawback to it is that it doesn't have storage built into the unit for both the phillips and flat head bits.

40703358	Alright, changed my review to one star after more extensive use.The drill itself is designed ok.  The bubble level is handy, the trigger is responsive and it's easy to control the speed based on how hard you press it. The drill feels solid enough.There are a number of problems that should steer you away from drill to a nicer drill though. At this price some corners have been cut.First, the drill doesn't generate that much power.  For the smaller gauges it works fine, but for the larger bit size (1/4 inch) if struggles to generate enough torque to get though tougher materials.  For drywall, using the screwdriver type attachments, and soft woods its probably ok, but forget it for any harder wood or getting anything really tight, you can generate more power with your hand.  Based on this, I'd recommend a nicer cordless drill, or a corded drill.Second, the drill bits are not labeled, had to compare them against a friend's and mark down the approximate sizes with a marker.Lastly, you can't use the drill without charging the battery, there's no way to directly plug it into a power source.  If you haven't used the drill in a while and the battery has lost it's charge, you'll have to wait to charge the battery, or if the battery runs out, you'll have to wait.  If the battery goes out your out of luck.  This would hamper the ability to do extended work with the drill. 	trangp	10-19-2015 19:47:17	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

24515488	If you're the kind of DIY person on a regular basis then you should get this one! I went to L****'s because I could not wait for delivery. The chipping bit is light and strong. None of the so called self help websites from TV ever mentioned that a 40 year old house bath tiles have chicken wire stapled to the sheet rock and then 3/8 cement then the porcelain tile.It took 6 hours with 4lb hammer and concrete chisel to do the back of the tub wall. It took 2 hours to do the wall on the long side about 1 hour to do the wall with the fixtures. The one inch floor tile squares came off with ease. In other words this tool rocks. Word of caution, face shield over safety glasses cannot be over emphasized, mine got two chips! The portion that is black must be the gear box even with leather gloves it is HOT! I used Amsoil grease on the SDS bit shaft and placed a thumbnail amount in the chuck. That seems to help quite a bit as it worked hard for four days ripping out this bathroom.This is my second Bosch tool and it's not made in Mexico or China so this is quality that I can rely on and not worry if it'll last through a job. The D handle comes in handy when leaning body parts to work chipping bit as your whole body and arms get tired and you can't stop.PLUS, this is the only one that had its narrative describe that it was 3 position with Hammer function. If the others had it I overlooked them but was looking hard for this function. The lavatory top had 1 cement and then the tile......this tool ripped right through it with ease. It only takes a slight amount of force exerted on the bit to get the hammer to walk down the line and score the grout and work through your work.Others have nice names based on American built history and rightly; so but the cheap labor quality leaves me out and I'll pay extra for my future Bosch tools.Pro or average Joe, this is a fine tool, light stout and hard working never skipped a beat and the bits is light strong and as of yet the angled chisel has no scares of any damage. Very impressive indeed. 	trangp	10-19-2015 19:48:42	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

Don't you hate having to wait around for a big, strong someone - with just the right tool - to do a bit of simple screwing so you can have a dreamed of bookshelf or day bed assembled, or have an amazing bit of intricate grill work hung on a bare wall, or a tubular bird feeder screwed to the deck or fence?One could easily use a manual screwdriver, but that is soooo last century, tedious, strains the wrist and does not create that Wow effect, i.e. neighbor envy when used outside. :)  Ah, if only you had a streamlined tool that wasn't too heavy, yet had plenty of stamina for lots of impromptu projects!DEWALT DCF815S2 12-Volt Max 1/4-Inch Impact Driver Kit is Perfect for smaller hands.  Why should the guys have all the cool tools?  Modern, sleek, light weight with lots and lots of energy -- and does not tire the hand, like a larger unit would.  Can be used throughout the house and around the outside for numerous projects us ladies sometimes wait-and-wait-and-wait for a guy to get around to doing. 'nuf said!This 12Volt lithium Ion battery kit takes  inch hex accessories and 1 inch bit tips, includes a charger and 2-battery packs, has forward/reverse control, 3-LED work lights, and quick release chuck and a very handy carrying bag.I initially used this tool to unscrew several bar stools for storage. It's compact size made it easy for me to maneuver between the stool chair pegs to unscrew the seats from the stools. This tool is lightweight, and powerful. Its chuck release is easy and efficient.

61508953	I WOULD have rated this compressor 4.5 stars or more, if it if it were not for a little, undetected by the factory DESIGN defect it has.  As you would know, Ozone (O3) is VERY DAMAGING to rubber items, and is also considered a lung and tissue irritant.  As designed (badly) by Dewalt engineers, they overlooked the fact that their design carries the electric motor cooling air, that passes through the motor brushes (where the damaging Ozone gas is produced) directly to the compressor enclosure, where it exits through some slots, but ALSO around a slot that is flush with the compressor's air INLET... thus, the compressor sucks some of the ozone laden air with every stroke of the piston, discharging this ozone contaminated air INTO the tank, ready to be delivered to your car's TIRES, which are made from RUBBER!!! ...  So, you end up putting some Ozone directly INTO your precious tires, inflatables or anything you use the air produced with this compressor!  I discovered this one day I was using it outside and it started raining, so I had to take the compressor inside my garage.  As soon as it started again to recharge the tank, I noticed the peculiar smell of the ozone (which is produced whenever electrical sparks occur). So I turned off the lights and could clearly see the sparking that any electric motor with brushes and commutator produces, but only this time I realized that the cooling air flow is carrying with it the ozone produced in the brushes, and because of the design of this Dewalt compressor, some of the produced ozone is able to get INTO the compressed air, as the Inlet Filter was placed too near (flush with) the plastic enclosure.  Since every time the piston sucks the air from the filter, that ozone contaminated air is being picked up by the filter, and ends up inside the tank, ready to be put into your rubber items like the tires on your car or bycicle...  even the rubber hoses will get some damage eventually.To solve this BAD DESIGN (being a natural tinkerer -Engineer, BTW-), I disassembled the plastic enclosure, installed some black foam rubber to seal the floor inside the enclosure to aisle it from the inlet filter, which I relocated about 2 1/4 inches downward by using a common galvanized pipe nipple and coupling, which happily enough, has the same threads, so you can put the pipe nipple into the compressor head using some PTFE tape (careful of not letting any inside the compressor head), and reattaching the plastic filter holder with a galvanized pipe coupler.  I enlarged the very small air passages on the air filter holder too, as they are too small, in order to let the compressor breath more easily (again, BAD design by Dewalt!  As modified, the compressor will now provide not only oil-free air, but ozone-free  air too!. Remember that it takes just a few parts per million of ozone to start damaging rubber, and the modifications costed me less that two dollars and less that an hour of my time.

25472606	I was looking for good table saw at a good price. Feature for feature the Jet ProShop 10 met most of my selection criteria. The order process, shipping and delivery went without a hitch (I actually got it three days earlier than promised).Set up took a friend and me about 90 minutes, and alignment checks another hour. The manual was clear and consise. A couple of notes on the assembly; we found most of the bolt holes in the frame had over spray from the powder coating process and that resulted in having to drive each bolt in all the way to clean it out before attempting to mount anything.I have two quality complaints; a large chunk of paint came off the side of the saw fame. This looks to be due to poor or inadequate surface preparation over about 15 square inches. The second was a defective end cap on the front rip fence rail.The saw was properly aligned and I had to make only a minor adjustments to the miter gauge and rip fence.Overall the saw runs very smoothly and quietly. It has adequate power for what I'm using it for (plywood, MDF and hardwoods) and is fine for a small hobbyist woodworking shop. I've run into a minor issue with dust collection and dadoing operations. I'm using a Delta Dust Collection system rated at 650 CMF. Dust seems to collect in the bottom of the saw when dadoing. I'm not sure if its a function of no vibration to move the dust along the bottom toward the dust collection port, or using a standard insert as opposed to a zero clearance insert. It's not critical as long as you remember to clean it out as part of your shop clean up routine.Regrets; yeah, I should have purchased the 50 model (and built a bigger garage. 	trangp	10-19-2015 19:54:47	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

30096662	I purchased this machine based on the specs. Supposedly it is dustless. I used it for vacuuming drywall/mud sanding.  I actually had the machine outside of the room so that the exhaust won't disturb the drywall all over the place. I looked outside to see that the machine was coated with a light layer of drywall that I sucked up.  The filter was on securely by the manufacturer. I also used the pre-filter bag to help the life of the filter. You can see the drywall dust came from the exhausting ports of the machine.  The machine is made with durable plastic.  The attachments could have gaskets or something to help seal and secure the vacuum.  I'd say this is one of the most powerful vacuums I have used, but it is also 2x the amount. It's light weight and moves easily.  I was just disappointed that the dustless claim was not real.  Also, there isn't a secondary layer when removing the pre-filter bag from the machine, so you might be getting some dust or debris floating around when discarding.  The attachments don't secure firmly to the tool holders. Sometimes the tools would fall off when moving the vacuum around.  I'd give it 3.5 stars. 	trangp	10-19-2015 19:54:47	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
53910740	I have been a remodel contractor for 30+ years .  I recently bought the Bosch MX25EK which is so-so in my opinion.  It is underpowered for a contractor except for occasional use.  The cost of the blades far exceeds their value and they wear out quickly often lasting only one or two cuts.  At $10+ for blades, use a reciprocating saw when you can. Sometimes, the size and action of the Bosch makes it worthwhile for those hard to get to places.  A handpowered, undercut saw, works faster for door trim.  It works well as a detail sander.  If you think you are going to be using it a lot, either buy a Fein, or the more expensive, heavy duty Bosch. 	trangp	10-19-2015 19:54:47	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes	Not sure if it wearing out quickly is a defect	false

52031077	My first encounter with Porter Cable tools two years ago in Kit form, Circular Saw, Recip Saw, Drill and working Light was through the redoubtable Lowes store.

Price and service is hard to beat and super convenient as my nearest Lowes is ten mile away.I have a lot of large trees and branches are always falling.The recipricating saw with a 9 inch pruning blade will cut up to four inches and the battery performs very well indeed with the very rapid re-charge, 	trangp	10-19-2015 19:57:20	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
47901396	I've had this tool for about a year.  I use it primarily to control dust from other tools.  I've hooked it up to sanders, routers, and a miter saw.  It won't totally eliminate the dust, which is mostly the fault of the tool it's attached to, but it does a great job of cutting down on the amount not captured.  I've used it for drywall (with 5quot; random orbit sander) and think it caught over 80% of the dust.  I would say it's even more efficient at controlling sawdust (sanding).I really like the quot;tool operatedquot; feature:  just plug your power tool into the vac; when you run the tool, the vac comes on automatically.  The hose is very durable; I've stepped on it a couple times inadvertently with no damage).  It's also very flexible and easy to move around and store without kinking or binding.  Rest of the tool is also high quality:  easy to open/close canister, logical switches, convenient handle. 	trangp	10-19-2015 19:58:22	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

41157157	My wife accidentally ordered two of these, but when the first one did not work I thought well at least there is an on hand back up available.  Too bad that one did not work either.  The power switch on both devices would not switch between on and off, it had no positive click felt between the two.  However, plugging the tool in and waving it around would cause it to power on intermittenly, sometimes staying on when stopping.  This is a huge safety issue in my opinion as there is no control over the device.  I've already returned both of them, but in hindsight I wish I had taken a video to post along with this review.

55036078	The LED lights are essentially useless, just a gimmick. The spark and eye shields just get in the way of doing anything, you would be much better off with a pair of goggles or safety glasses. Unit seems fairly powerful but it will slow somewhat with heavy pressure. Would be nice if it came with one stone and one wire brush instead of two stones but that would probably add a little to the cost. It seems to be well balanced and runs smoothly, very little vibration or tendency to #34;walk#34; and I do not even have it secured to the bench. Remains to be seen how long it will last but for now I say, for the price, you could do a lot worse. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:01:09	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

41035337	When I originally reviewed this drill, I was thinking that the evolving battery technology sort of left this one in the past. Well, now I have second thoughts. Having had the drill for well over 5 years, it's still going...and going...and going. The batteries--well, the original NiCads lasted me maybe 4 years, which isn't too shabby. But lately, I've seen that you can get NiMH 3 amp-hour batteries for this baby on Ebay at a very nice buy-it-now price.So, combine the new batteries with a drill that is fairly light weight, a huge range of speeds, and, as I said, just shows no signs of wearing out after 5 years and multiple tumbles off the workbench...All I can say is, Dewalt knows how to make a drill. The 400 in-lbs of torque comes in very handy for sinking lag screws deep into wood or for using Forstener bits. That's a lot of torque. You can get a bigger Dewalt drill, like the 14.4 or 18 v versions, but they weigh more (in the case of the 18 V, a LOT more).Some other alternatives: The Panasonics seem to be at the top of the heap with 3 to 3.5 amp-hours with their NiMH  battery packs, and Makita's lithium ion batteries on their 18 v unit have 3 amp-hours. The tiny Makita, recently out, has a 1.5 amp-hour battery that charges in 30 minutes, and is super lightweight. I own the 2 Makitas, and the smaller one is my prefereed (except when I need to hammer drill)--but I don't know yet if either will outlast this Dewalt. I've already had clutch problems with my larger Makita.In sum, if you want a durable, long-lasting, high-torque, very variable speed drill that doesn't weigh too much, this one may be hard to beat. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:01:09	No Defect		Indeterminate	No	He has used this tool for 5 years but I am not sure if that makes him an expert.	false

I went to Bissell's web site for help and was able to find some instructions about making sure that tubes were secure, etc. I was glad to find help, but I wish the mop wouldn't leak. Also, after you dry vac, you need to change the pad otherwise you are spreading dirt from the dry vac pad all over your floor. I wouldn;t recommend this product if you are looking for a mop. But if you just need a floor vac, this works well. It holds a charge for 10 or 15 minutes which allows me to vacuum the floors several times per week.

46720804	The metal (steel?) fence is solid and works as well as a table saw fence. Along with the engraved proximal and distal metal rulers on the smooth steel table, alignment of a tile with the blade is rapid and accurate.  Table tilt feature is well-designed.  Miter gauge is plastic but sufficiently tight to the fence to make a reasonably accurate miter cut.  Motor is quiet, blade is of good quality.  Tub for water bath is made of strong plastic.  Rubber feet for vibration-free use of saw.  Carry handle on side makes it easy to move from one location to another.  It comes with a storage/carry case that provides superb protection.  I consider this to be a fine tool, and in my opinion it should be hosed clean after every use and the metal parts wiped down to keep it that way. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:05:14	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
42422914	This is actually my first nailer and probably my last.  The build quality is second to none.  I've used it to do repairs and for some of my own creations as well.  Nailing into soft and hard woods is of the utmost ease.  The exhaust port is a little snug and therefore difficult to turn but adds to the feeling of sturdiness that is so reassuring.  You know that it won't slip and point in the wrong direction while you're not looking.  I usually run anywhere between 80 and 90 PSI.  I can't comment on how easy it is to clear jams because I simply  haven't had one yet and I've driven over 1000 nails to this point.  It's much lighter than you would expect.  The case is adequate.

After about a year of dealing with it I just bought a new Porter Cable compressor and have had no problems since then.

36151941	After laying 480 square feet of bamboo and about 250 square feet into a 900 sq ft oak project, this nailer hasn't had a single mistep. I've assisted in putting down hardwood before, but this is my first personal project. I'm not able to work straight through to completion (to many interuptions)so renting a nailer would have rapidly cost more than purchase. Nobody I talked to recommended a manual nailer, especially considering they aren't exactly cheap either. However, the prices on many of the recommended power nailers seemed very high for something I may only use for about 2000 square feet of floor; and I never sell tools, no matter how seldom they're used. After reading the reviews here, I decided to go with the Porter-Cable and am very glad I did. I used 2 inch Bostich nails and 75 PSI. I never let the tool run out of nails and have had zero problems. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:08:33	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
40992360	As I inventoried my new Dremel and all its attachments, I couldn't figure out how to attach the light, even with the diagram in the book.  It appears that the clip on the light is too large for the insertion spot on the Dremel.  I called customer service to inquire as to whether I could have received a light that was meant for a different model or some further instruction on how to attach the light.  The customer service representative was so condescending that I was made to feel like an idiot for not knowing how the light attached and she assured me that it did attach the way the book illustrated and implied that, if I would just use some common sense, I could do it.  I still don't know how the thing attaches and it really isn't a necessary component for most jobs, so I don't know if I care.  The clip is simply larger than the slot it is supposed to go in to.  Otherwise, the tool is fine and works like a champ.

82347199	I wanted a powerful multi-tool because my first one from Sears, a rechargeable, with wrench for blade changes,  was a weakling and would stall and battery would wear out in no time. And blade changes were a hassle . .  you could never get it tight enough, and the hex receptacle got stripped. Sears put that one out before it was fully baked. In fact, it's off the market now.So, I went for this Rockwell multi-tool with electric cord and 3.0 AMPS.  . . . .HOLY MACKERAL this thing sizzles, cuts moldings and creates clearances etc. Worth every penny in the time it saves me!  I don't have to worry about a low battery. And the quick release/locking system works great...after I figured out all the ins and outs of how that locking handle worked.  It has a good case, and long enough power cord. Rockwell did their homework. Really!  Plus this tool can take many other makes of blades, so you never get stuck. Changing the non-Rockwell tools takes an extra step, but at least it can do it, and you never worry about having to find a certain make of blade.It's heavier than my first mult-tool, but not problem, that's what you get with more power.

53133952	Just purchased the Delta 14-651 mortiser from Amazon.  Shipping was exceptionally quick, however the packing material was in bad shape when I opened the box.  Once degreased and assembled I found that the head would not travel smoothly along the column - it would jamb in some areas and move easily in others.  After some investigation I found out that the rack (the long straight gear on the column) was very poorly machined.  After about an hour and a half of work with a mill file I was able to even out the teeth and widen/deepen the notches on the rack.  The mortiser now moves smoothly on the column.I'm happy with the mortiser now that the movement has been fixed, but beware of poor quality in the rack and gear system. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:14:37	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

50301626	I bought this drill to replace my cheap old Black  Decker which had finally bit the dust after about 12 years (pretty good for a $30 Chinese drill). I bought it because it seemed nice, powerful, and Assembled (not MADE) in USA.As soon as I went to test it, though, I noticed a lot of run out in the chuck.I did a little drilling, and it seemed to work fine, although it did emit a rather high pitched whine from the motor.I switched to Hammer Mode, and it started to turn, then stuck, and smoked.I took it back, and switched back to an el cheapo Chinese made Black  Decker. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:15:27	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
21624981	this set is great but the battery is not compatible with the many other sets (i thought it was)  so if you are going to buy more tools like a circular saw, electric wrench, jigsaw, or a hammer drill this set is a bad purchase just because the battery wont be compatible.  if none of the tools i listed are needed This set is definitely a 5. dewalt is top quality at the best price in my opinion. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:15:27	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

37171273	I picked up the unit at the truck terminal because their forklift could load it on a pickup which can be backed up to the shop door. No shipping damage whatsoever that I could see. The mobile base was a big help.  We set up the base cabinet and mobile base first and then took everything except the jointer out of the long box.  We slit the box sides and were able to turn the jointer on its side to clean it up and get rid of the styrofoam.  Using cardboard, we slid it from the truck bed onto the base to save on lifting.  Uh oh, the motor was supposed to be mounted at the factory;It was not and hard to get to as well.  The manual and pics say to adjust the belt tension with the motor mounts--not true.  The frame bars are moved, not the motor mounts.  Never could get the spring on the guard to tension and will ask for a replacement for that.  Just a simple adjustment to square the fence at 90 deg to the table.  The tables were in perfect alignment as were the knives.  I had a scrap piece of alder bowed on 2 sides.  The jointer took almost all of the bow out before I decided to cut a few inches off the ends.  All 4 sides are smooth as glass.  Even though the beast is made in China, it's very good quality compared to some of my other machines made there.  I'm very happy with it and would have given 5 stars if the motor had been installed and the manual written correctly.  Yes, I read the manual and think that it should be written correctly and the pictures, too.  The machine is very stable on the mobile base which is really a heavy duty model.  I did buy mine from ToolCrib via phone because I had some questions which were answered okay.  This is a much better place to write reviews rather than trying to search for them on the various woodworking forums.  It's oh so much easier to find the reviews here than other places.  Hope y'all will help us out with your review as well.  Thanks!Update:  I got a replacement spring for the guard assembly in less than 24 hrs. from Delta.  Now that's service! 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:27:20	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

42558759	Wonderfull for trim work, moldings, general uses and furniture making.  This is the one that started it all with dual side by side glides, and it is still the best out there.  I have had mine for 9+ years and it is a true as the day I bought it.  I do wish that it beveled both ways, but can work around that.  There has been a lot of inovation in this market since this saw was introduced, but it still holds its own among the pack.  It is extrememly accurate. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:27:20	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
35542984	Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase.  Both the jointer and planer seem to work great with plenty of power for the things that I have needed to do.  To switch modes between the jointer and the planer is very simple and requires only a small amount of time and effort.  The only major drawback that I can see is the table length.  It is about 36 long, which can make it very difficult to get any twists or bows out when trying to joint longer pieces of stock.  Other than that, it is a great machine and I am very satisfied with my purchase.  It is the perfect machine for a small, home-based shop. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:28:48	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
51049241	This product didn't work correctly from the beginning.  The LED work light didn't come on but the motor turned.  So, instead of returning it I decided to give it a try.

57930249	This unit is a cheap way to get into a belt sander and it seems to be of reasonable quality.  I've purchased several recon tools from assorted online sellers and have no regrets:  they've performed well.  But, recons are not always a smart choice.  Home Depot, for example, is an exclusive outlet for Ryobi tools.  They sometimes offer full warranty new tools for LESS than a recon tool.Be sure to check around for pricing on this one.  Shipping charges through this seller are excessive and, since it does not qualify for free shipping, you'll likely do better elsewhere.Very happy with this sander but I did not buy it on Amazon. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:28:48	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
23338081	I've used this router exactly 3 times in the past 6 years. Each session has been no longer than 10 minutes, with light work jobs (door hinges). 2 of the 3 times the on/off switch failed. I have to take it in to a repair shop to replace the switch / diagnose the thing. It's now cost me more to repair it than it did to buy it. When it actually works, it did a fine job. Recommend avoiding this router, which I see is now unavailable. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:28:48	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
36106483	I've been using this little router for some 20 years now and it is my go-tool for any most of my routing tasks.  I have half a dozen routers in the shop, including some very expensive and precision units, but this little guy is so handy that unless I need super stability or precision micro-adjustments, I grab this one.  It has done miles of laminate and counter-edge trimming of oak and other hardwoods, and after probably hundreds of hours of use it is still running as new.Is it perfect?  No.  The height adjustment is at best, primitive.  I've just learned how to set its depth-of-cut with minimum follow-up corrections.  The nut that is supposed to secure the base to the body needs to be tightened with pliers, since hand tightening is just not enough to prevent it from loosening and then moving during a cut.  My trimmer came with the full laminate-trimming kit in a nice steel carrying case, and back when laminate counter tops were still acceptable in kitchens, this kit was great.I routinely abuse this little machine by doing long 12#8221; radius roundovers on long beams and such, and it has never overheated or shown any signs of stress. I like the fact that it has a shaft-lock so that only one wrench is required to change bits.  The button is not very well placed, however, and I seem to hit it occasionally during use.  No damage has resulted, but it makes a lot of noise and is no doubt not good for the tool.  Also, the power switch is not placed well, as it is a two-handed operation to shut the machine off.Bottom line:  After more than 20 years of use, I'd replace this tool with another just like it. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:28:48	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

46765210	I've now used this saw on a couple of projects and am pleased with the saw's performance except for the laser. i've replaced the batteries twice and now need to replace them again. the odd bit is that the laser hasn't been turned on for more than a couple of minutes. i would like to see rockwell retool this laser and replace the lasers on this model. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:34:28	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
32192280	Smooth running machine w/ tight fit and feel.  Quality components.  Dust collection needs improving.  No option given for dust bag.  Cast miter scale gets covered w/ sawdust as does magnified pointer (Keep an air nozzle handy!)  I ended up using a Sharpie to make some of the angles more visible. Dust gets into bevel lock down causing saw head to slide down to 45' bevel, even during a cut. Customizable miter stop feature allows for one stop only...not very helpful when doing crown, base or other cuts where you need a corresponding angle.  Fence extensions do not slide far enough out of the way and must be disassembled to reach certain compound angles.  Miter lock handle quickly became loose and fell off.  Trigger safety button would be nice.  Quality laser would be nice.  I've owned this saw for about a year and still can't get used to it.  I find myself going back to my nine-year-old Makita LS 1211.  I would not buy this saw again. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:34:28	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
27706735	Beware.  They send faulty equipment and then expect you to fix it yourself at your own expense.  The shut off switch stopped working after just one hour of use.  They sent us a new part, but it's complicated to switch, and you have to have the right tools, which we don't.  We paid thousands for a brand new item, and received a faulty item with no support to fix it.  We are considering sending it back for a refund.

31335102	Bought over a year ago to cut pinewood derby cars, and other misc projects in the shop.  Product came with broken switch on work light, fortunately it's stuck 'ON' so I know when it's plugged in.Getting the smaller woodworking blades to cut straight is difficult.  Have to closely monitor the spacing of the upper AND lower guides.  Larger metal type blades were much easier to manage.Not a heavy duty machine for all day cutting.  Exhaust system does not clean out the fine saw dust, even with a powerful shop-vac attached.It's fine for occasional, light work.  Not suitable for heavy cutting of thick or dense material. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:34:28	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

61421942	I've been a carpenter for over 30 years learning trim with a miter box and back saw. I've used nearly every miter saw, and the 1030n is the best. The fence is tall enough for medium crown (4 1/4)and the fence slot is close enough that small pieces are not blown out on the floor. If you do this for a living this is it...less than 25 lbs, and has a top handle. Easy to carry on the job from floor to floor, but what a work horse. No tool does it all, for what it does do it is in a field all by itself. Accuracy is perfect out of the box no adjustment necessary. It is smooth and flawless.Complaint: It is not made in the USA. I buy only American made unless I have no choice. Listen Makita had it not had the good feel I would have looked elsewhere.I have nothing against other people, but I have too many friends out of work to justify buying foreign. To you out of work I am sorry. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:35:40	No Defect		Expert	No		false

31599194	I like the size, and the vac has pretty good suction. Nails and bits of wire get pulled up, but not very far. The handle came cracked on one end. The handle would feel better if it were smooth on the inside instead of honeycomb where the fingers actually lift. Dumping the dust from the base is messy. An incorporated external vortex chamber would have been a really good idea, catching the majority of debris first and being easier to dump. The basic vac comes without suction heads for the floor, and without a sponge for wetvac operation. The sponge wet filter would have been a cheap and easy give away, and seems like it would have increased the usufulness at little extra cost. Perhaps the sales strategy was to upsell the extras packages. It just made me feel shortchanged. The cord is adequate length, but could have been a bit longer. Hose storage is almost nonexistent, the single hook that snaps on to the base only holding the end of the hose, not several loops. There is no cord storage strategy. It does come on Auto well when the crosscut saw turns on, and off when off, the dust seems fairly well collected, but if auto is not on, dust goes all over, and it is not easy to visualize the on/off  with either of the two buttons (Power and Auto). It is fairly quiet, and lightweight. The cloth filter shakes out easily,but once again, gets dust on the shaker easily. I tried to keep the wind at my back, but it was strong enough to have eddies blow it back on me. The attempt to bag the debris was hindered by having nothing underneath to hold onto with one hand while holding the plastic bag with the other hand.Yes, I would buy it again, because I still feel the engineering is good, but the vaulue is not as strong for the money given as I had hoped. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:36:38	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

523530	I am a young guy just married and settled into our first house so I needed some new power tools had some older ones that worked for the projects I had when renting an apt. in a city(not much area for building things) I have always like to build and fix things possibly why I became and engineer. I went back and forth between Milwaukee Tool and Dewalt and the more I looked and price as well as pros and cons from contractor friends and mechanic friends one of them said why do you need pro-grade tools yes they work great and last a long time but he said why dont I save some money and look at like black and decker they are lower cost and work fantasic for what I need. So for Christmas my father in law got us the 20v matrix (I say us because my wife and I build and do projects together she also enjoys it) I have used the Drill, Router, cutoff saw and Impact so far on a recent build and they all worked great) the battery has a good life to it ( I did buy a 2nd battery right away though may not have needed it after using it but nice to have) I would highly recommend this for any DIY person. surely I would not build a house with this even a big deck might be a bit too much for it that I would borrow something better from a friend. but its a great tool at a great price. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:37:48	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

33745911	I've had this saw for a month, using it on an installation, and it's living up to my expectations completely. This is the Bosch tile saw, but, in my opinion enhanced by Lackmond. I'd never heard of them, but reading the background information about it, and seeing that it looked identical to the Bosch, and being manufactured in the same facility, it looked like a candidate as my next tile saw. Three things on it made me want this over the Bosch: the laser cutting guide, the LED work light, and the included wheeled base. Angled cuts are a breeze, and no more drawing lines and #34;eyeballing#34; it to align with the blade. you don't even have  to turn the motor off. One little issue: the laser has an alignment adjustment, and it keeps wandering off, and needs constant realignment, but it's easy, with the two knobs right on the front. I'm thinking of putting some thread-locking compound on them to stiffen it up. The blade runs perfectly true to the table. I don't know why you'd even need an adjustment, except for the fact that it wanders off. I haven't needed the work light on this job, but there's times I wish I had one. now I do.I'm a general contractor, and not a full time tile contractor, but I do enough tile to where owning a saw is the most economical way for me. I previously owned the Dewalt tile saw, but my son fell in love with it, so now it's his. I now like this saw better, and it has more power and greater flexibility.IT ALSO HAS MORE POWER THAN THE BOSCH.I've used the Target and MK saws, and they're great, and the motors on them are quieter and may last longer, but the sound of the blade cutting is just as loud as any tile saw. The Bosch and the Dewalt have motors with brushes, and are noisier than the induction motors on the Target and DeWalt saws. I have saws with brushes that are over 15 years old that haven't had problems, so this should last a long time.And this saw is way more versatile than the standard ten inch tile saws. This one will rip a 24#34; tile, which is one of the dimensions on this job. I can line up a row of tile to cut a long taper, line up the laser across the tiles from narrow to wide, and voila! a handful of tapered cuts. I like it!I wish it came with the plastic trays that the Bosch has, but the ones that come with it are working. I have a little area set up where I'm using it, with some plastic sheeting around the side and back. It's minimally messy, with only a few drops hitting the floor. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:39:00	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
27731929	This tool has worked great for my projects. This has been reliable and has nice high speeds.

56695737	Like some other reviewers I expected to only use this tool on rare occasion so I didn't want to lay out a lot of money.After I got it, I realized how useful it was. I used it to cut some PVC pipe and it worked very well for that.  So then I used it to scrape a small amount of dried on glue from a concrete floor.  Worked great for that too.Put it away, came back to use it a few weeks later and it didn't work.  Motor still goes but the mechanism that drives the oscillation was busted.The tool was never dropped, was not heavily used or abused in any way.

50844284	I purchased the DeWalt rolling stand and jobsite saw a few months ago, and I am very pleased with both.  I have very little space for storing and using my shop tools, so the compact rolling stand was an attractive option.  The stand is rock solid, and puts the saw at a convenient height.  The whole package (saw and table,) is pretty heavy, but the large wheels make it easy to roll up over the sill out the side door of my garage, and the wide stance of the folding legs keeps the table steady. When packed away, the whole thing takes up about two square feet of floor space in my very tightly packed garage.My only complaint is the lack of an outlet box, either on the saw or the table, to that the saw and dust collector can be plugged in and turned on/off together.Despite that minor inconvenience, I would definitely recommend this table and a matching saw to anyone who is challenged for space. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:42:34	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

42815772	This compressor appears to match its specifications. It is the quietest I've heard in this class, although my unit does have an occasional squeal-- something rubbing --that is not much louder than the normal sound, but is a little more obnoxious. Also, like some other reviewers, I encountered loose bolts on the unit I received: the four bolts that secure the tanks to the frame needed tightening. Not difficult to tighten them, but it's odd to have so many loose screws running around! Overall, the workmanship and functionality seems very good. Many compressors of this size have wheels, and that would make handling easier. Pleased with the product to date. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:45:36	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

54603419	I just bought this saw after doing much research. I was a little cautious after reading some of the negative reviews here on amazon.com.  I have done woodworking for nearly 20 years, and wanted to upgrade from a sears craftsman contractor saw. After speaking with another local woodworker who does period reproductions on commission and repairs furniture for a living, he told me he bought this same saw and was very happy with it.  I purchased this saw from a local woodworking specialty and hardware vendor in our area for $1044.00.The saw was in very good condition. One tiny mark on the table top that can be sanded down occurred during shipping. The saw was fairly easy to set up, and I have achieved less than .001 parallel on the Biesmeyer fence with the miter slot. The blade that comes with the saw is only fair.  I replaced it with a Freud industrial blade and it runs great.  The rails  are just a bit confusing at first, but take your time and you will get them installed in the correct holes after a few moments.  The belt was a breeze to put on the pulleys, with a block of 2x4 and a pry bar to lift the motor.  The table extensions lined up very nicely.The motor plainly says 3450 rpm, not the 3000 rpm in delta's literature.  The 3450 rpm is industry standard for a 15 amp motor, so don't be worried about the misprint in the literature. The 1-3/4 horsepower motor is an upgrade over most contractor saws with 1-1/2 horsepower rating.I think that Delta Machinery has corrected the bugs that some machines evidently had at the beginning of manufacture. I highly recommend this saw to serious woodworkers and believe it to be a good value and a good product.This is not a Unisaw!  However, it has many of the excellent features and quality workmanship of the unisaw, and if you do not use it commercially in a full time cabinet shop or similar business, the saw should give you many years of good service.  I am a stickler for precision, and the saw required only minor adjustments to make it very accurate.I did the nickel test, by standing a nickel on the table top. I started the saw, ran it for a few minutes, and turned the saw off and the nickel stayed standing!  Once you break in the belt for a few minutes, the saw is very smooth.  The longer I have the saw, the happier I am with my decision to purchase it!Update - after owning and using this saw for over 6 months, and having done most of a bathroom remodel, including new base cabinets, chimney closet, and medicine chest made from red oak, the saw has performed flawlessly, even with many dado cuts, and rabbit cuts.  I still have a sink vanity to build, and look foward to getting back in the shop when the weather warms enough for glue to set up.This saw is the real deal!  For someone who does not have the electrical for a 220 volt hookup, and the room for a unisaw, this saw is on the same quality with the unisaw, just not as much horsepower.  I have been very, very satisfied!!!  This is a great saw!Update: January 2011  I am still very happy with this saw.  I don't know that they are making it anymore, but this saw has met all my expectations, and has given me great service, without a single issue.  Anyone who might find one used, would do well, if it is in good shape.  Four years later, I am still glad I bought this saw. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:46:41	No Defect		Expert	No		false

38112280	The saw is great. It has all the power you will ever need for any wood or composite trim work. And I've used mine for very heavy work including cutting old and very dry 1 solid oak old barn floors. The stand is excellent for portable work. Although I will warn that the extensions aren't very tight, so don't count on them for a square cut. When folded the legs act as arms for a 2-person carry. Therein does lie one other criticism. It's a big large and akward for a single person. So consider a smaller saw without a stand if you work alone and have to carry it around. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:47:54	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

The price was slightly higher than what it would cost to rent a SDS drill but I figured after the cost of driving to and from the rental store, it would be a wash.

33421815	I'll admit up front that I haven't touched the wine bottle opener bit - I got this purely to use as a screwdriver because I need a compact but powerful rechargeable screwdriver around the house. And the main point that was appealing to me with this unit is the fact that it's powered by a lithium ion battery. I know now, after having suffered with other battery types (nicad, I believe) that lithium ion is the way to go because, once charged, they hold a solid charge for a long time. And true to form, this little driver has been sitting around, doing light duty - a quick tighten here and there - and still has as much drive-force as the moment it came off the charger. And this is a good couple months after I got it. Sure, when the battery runs out of juice, it'll just go, as lithium ion batteries run and run and run and then it's just kaputt, but that's good. I'd rather that than a gradual decline where there's a small window of good power and the screwdriver becomes more and more useless over time. I'm sure anyone who's used rechargeable screwdrivers is nodding their head at memories of small projects where those last screws are put in by turning that whole screwgun's mostly powerless body with the motor groaning. The battery, for those looking for this info, takes 3-5 hours to charge, according to the manual. Mine had a charge when I got it, so it didn't need a full charge.It's laid out very intelligently, with the forward/backward switch placed right where your thumb or finger can reach it when you're holding it, and has a bright amber light aimed at your screw head. It's got a lot of torque for such a small driver, but it does have its limits. Don't expect to build a cabinet with this thing, is what I'm saying. I haven't done any major jobs with it, but it's strong enough for most home jobs, but you'll want the big tools for heavy work.It comes with the obvious wine bottle opener, a foil cutter, and a chromed-metal rubber bottle stopper in addition to the actual useful, you know, *tools* - a small selection of bits held in a rubbery container. They're all the standard 1/4 inch hex size (if I'm not mistaken) so any other heads you have that fit will also work in this driver provided they are short enough to fit in the barrel. But there's one small nit to pick, and that is that in all the little extras they pack in they couldn't manage to offer *some* kind of case to hold all of this stuff. What am I supposed to do with all of this? I take it out and it all wanders around drawers, eventually getting lost. I won't be too upset losing the wine bottle parts, but I won't be very happy to lose the driver bits - but luckily my other driver heads fit in here. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:50:49	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

Was not to thrilled about the oil dipstick,It was difficult to screw in without cross threading, and is difficult to read oil level. A sight glass would have been a welcome addition. I have used this compressor about a dozen times for simple shop tasks, inflating, cleaning and it handles my 1/2 impact for tire removal. Pump up time is minimal, about a minute and a half, and recovery time is 20 to 30 seconds. I was surprised at how quiet this compressor is. This is my first oil filled compressor.

41415235	The infeed / outfeed tables attach easily to the DeWalt DW735 planer, but you must install them before you bolt the planer down to the table.  I didn't.  ;-)  That's not a complaint, but a note to future purchasers.The tables fold up out of the way easily, and can be easily removed and reinstalled, once the mounting studs have been installed in the planer base.The tables are useful as work supports, but they do not lie in the same plane as the planer's cast iron base.  They droop a little, meaning they do not provide the protection against snipe, that I had hoped they would.  I think they can be modified, with a couple of jack screws to better support the tables, aligning them with the planer base.  One more thing to do. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:52:51	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

36515151	As I stare at my box full of old cordless drills and their depleted NiCad batteries, I can only wish that this drill was available much earlier. After retiring my DeWalts and Makita's and realizing that there is no shame in using an extension cord, I vowed never to throw money away again at a cordless and their overpriced NiCad batteries.Forced into a job site with no power, I purchased this drill from Amazon at a good price and put it through its paces with a variety of drill loads. Some specifics:1) The first impression has to be its small size, weight, quality of feel, balance. Obvious quality of materials and manufacturing.2)The chuck has to be the best that I have ever used. Easiest to change bits, extremely tight grip on both small (1/16) and large bits. Outstanding engineering concept and achievement.3) Speed control has two ranges and mesh perfectly from slow driver speed to fast drilling. Excellent trigger feel and response.4) And now the power. Don't even think of stalling this brute. The 3.5AH NiMH batteries have incredible reserve and recharge capablity. The charger is well designed and will quickly charge a depleted battery. These batteries seem to last all day.If you are thinking of a (the) top quality cordless drill that will last for many years and handle any job, this is the obvious choice. Well worth the cost, which is price competitive with the other 15-18v drill selections.You deserve this !! 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:53:45	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
22450733	I've needed a new jig saw for quite some time, since my old one gave up the ghost. But not being a serious woodworker, it was something I just wouldn't commit myself to buying. Not because I didn't need one (ask the folks I've borrowed one from), but because I just didn't have the time to sort through all the ins-and-outs of jig saws. What speed? How many amps? What tools did I need to go with it?Well, if you need a good jig saw for those around-the-house projects such as building shelves, etc., look no more! As noted in the details, the 6amp JS680V Jigsaw will deliver any cut you need in almost any material that can be cut! Unsure what speed setting you need? It's easy with the Smart-Select Dial, which allows you to just set it for the project you need, and the saw automatically adjusts its speed. This was awesome for me, because I don't like looking at my tools wondering where I put the manual or what a certain setting is for. Keep in mind, this is NOT a band saw. But it will make some nice cuts where you need them. Some may say that this does not compare to a $200 DeWalt or Makita, but to me I don't need that level of a saw. The Black  Decker JS680V does the same thing those saws do for a third of the price!This saw also comes with the LineFinder system, which is a rather unique concept. Instead of using the traditional laser, which of course can't follow curves, the linefinder consists of a special UV-type pen that looks like a highlighter. The light on the saw illuminates the lines that you draw on your project almost like a blacklight. It's actually pretty impressive. I can't say how well it will hold up, long term, or how much a replacement pen will cost, but I'm hopeful it will hold up. I can see it being especially helpful when making curvy cuts.As noted, the JS680V Jigsaw feels very durable and well-built. It has rubber gripping along the handle, which allows for a solid grip while using it. It also has a cast shoe, which seems as solid as any other brand I checked out. The shoe is then covered with heavy plastic so it glides smoothly. And you don't need any special tools to change out the blades, which is nice. The saw is weighty, but is not too heavy in the hands for most folks to use.Finally, as a casual user, there are two small features that I really like: first, the saw comes with a magnetic on board blade storage that will hold 3 blades. It's basically a little storage compartment on the side. So no more digging around wondering where I put that extra blade! The other feature is that you can easily change the angle adjustment, and it has bevel markings that show you the bevel (15/30/45) through an indicator window, taking the guess-work out of whether you have it set right.Overall, you will not be disappointed with this saw. I really feel that Black  Decker has stepped up the quality of their products lately, and the JS680V Jigsaw demonstrates this as well as anything. The only thing that I can see that would add to the overall value would be for BD; to include cutting blades for metal or plastic (it comes with a blade for wood), and a kit box for storage. As it stands, you have to find someplace to put it when not in use, which of course requires that you remove the blade so it doesn't get broken or you don't get cut. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:53:45	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
53027015	This planer is a wonderful addition to my collection of Delta woodworking tools.  I purchased 4 days ago and have already run through about 60 bd.ft. of white birch.  The results are among the best I've produced and I can't believe I've attempted furniture building without this machine.  Like most reviewers, I found the 2-speed option mostly trivial and just leave it on the 90 cpi setting.  The manual is quite good (as most Delta manuals are) and I was cutting wood within an hour of bringing it home.  For a perfectly smooth finish, you'll want to take off another 1/64th with a cabinet scraper.  The results using the planer and scraper produced simply luscious results that require me to give this machine 5 stars.  Excellent! 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:53:45	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

61271721	I've not had the opportunity to use the drill much yet.  If in five years it's still performing as well as it is now, it will definitely get that last star.  The keyless chuck works well and is easy to use.  The trigger has a sensitivity that allows quite a range of speeds.  A longer cord would be nice, but there's enough room in the case for an extension cord.  So far I'm happy with the drill.  Perhaps if I were less of a cynic, I would give the drill five stars. 	trangp	10-19-2015 20:55:13	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
38207296	The rotary cut-out tool I purchased (9/2013), Type 3 as stated on tool lable, was recalled in 2006.

45222019	We bought this, then returned it. The last owner of our home had laid tile without taking up the baseboards. They were nailed in below the tile line and we couldn't get them out. We purchased this tool because it was recommended for this particular job. Unfortunately, I thought my house was going to burn down from the heat and smell of cutting. We called the company to see if we were doing it wrong. They suggested that we do the job at a higher speed, but it didn't do the trick.

This drill really is a good performer at the price.  I would compare the quality to that of Dewalt so far.  I didn't have the chuck issues the other reviewer had.  At the same time I ended up buying the 7-piece compact set.  The tools in that are slightly lower quality but again, very high.  No issues with them.  The lifetime battery replacement is what really sold me!  It is a little sketchy though on the terms... need original proof of purchase and can change terms of the program at any time.

35877241	I had this saw for years now. Its heavy but then again, once you see the metal case you should not expect any less. The unit purrs as it makes short work of nails, ply, studs, metal pipe, roots, pvc, fencing, posts ... yeah, your fingers if you're not careful.I love the power, the control switch, variable speed and orbital blade control.  Its all about control and calculation at work, safety.Changing the blade is easy even when hot thanks to the rubber cover.  The handle is nice and the rubber part on the front makes it for a natural grip.  Its a comfortable tool as long as its used properly as it is powerful as well as heavy.If you're a homeowner, it will probably be a little much but if you're starting to get into the trades or are in the trades, we all know Milwaukee has legendary sawalls but I would say the JR3070 gives you a lot more for the buck with a cool look to add to the mix.

40551917	First I bought here on ToolCrib the Bosch 3727DEVS 6 and Bosch 3725DEVS 5 random orbital sanders and loved them. They are both good tools. I manufacture R/C model sailboats out of fiberglass and I have used them every day for a year now and they are excellent. So.. when DeWalt ran their special last month for $250.00+ purchase I need to fill out my order and I picked up a RECONDITIONED DW423KR 5.I did not expect it to be as good as the Bosch...  WHAT A SURPRISE I received! It is smaller and lighter than the Bosch sanders, and does not have the added handle they have which means it can get into tighter areas... but then does not have the pure power of being able to manhandle it because of the missing handles. ok,... it is as smoooooth as the Bosch 6 which has the extra ballbearing set the Bosch 5 does not. Power? The DeWalt is ever bit the heavy duty tool they say it is packed into that little frame and it came with it's own case/box which is always a plus with me.The DW423KR uses the same hook/loop paper you use on your other 5 sanders and has the same 8 hole dust removal pattern. A small shopvac will take the dust right off the project surface when you mount it to the dust exhaust.The only thing I can knock the DW423KR on is that while it is a variable speed tool... it is basically variable between medium and high... there is not much if any range in a low or slow speed.... so you have to back off your grit instead of just backing the speed way down. Other than that.. it is almost a magic wand that makes the errors go away. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:13:43	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

58431207	Three full seasons of the year either my husband or I have to use a shop vac to get leaves and other natural debris out of our garage.  We keep the door to the garage open all day because that is our easiest access into the house, but this is also allowing all kinds of things to blow in the garage and potentially become a hazard.  The old vacuum we have been using for years finally gave up the pitiful little bit of suction it came with and had become nothing more than something sitting in the corner.  We are both very well pleased with our new Workshop wet/dry vac.The instruction manual which comes with the vacuum is adequate because only the casters and caster covers actually need to be assembled.  The caster covers have indentations where you can park the utility pieces like extra nozzles and extension wands plus there are four more indentations on the top of the 16 gallon capacity unit.  The pleated paper filter for dry vacuuming is already installed and can be used for a very small amount of liquid pick-up.  Any large amount of liquid removal will necessitate you installing a different filter made specifically for wet material removal.  That wet filter is not included with the unit and a visit to the product website shows the filter will cost around $22 extra.  The 12 gallon unit can be used with the included dust bag, but that option is not available on the 16 gallon unit.  By moving the hose to the exhaust port you can use the vacuum as a blower.  There are three attachments: utility nozzle, wet nozzle, and car nozzle plus two extension wands.  The car nozzle is really quite handy to have and we have used it along with the basic utility nozzle.  Included also is something called a locking sleeve (a rubber type tube) to add extra strength in accessory connections.  Wow, would I ever love to be able to watch a video of how in heck that thing is supposed to be utilized.  Maybe I should have gone looking to see if there is a YouTube video?  We finally gave up and resorted to our tried-and-true method for keeping the sections of extra wands and hose connected.This is a wet/dry vacuum with a great deal of power.  It definitely lives up to the description of high capacity.  The unit is made in Mexico with the instruction manual written in English, Spanish, and French.  The casters roll very smoothly so it is easy to pull the vacuum along with you as you work.  The hose snaps securely to the inlet of the vac and detaches simply by pressing on the red release.  There is an on/off red toggle switch.  Removing the top completely is the way to empty the drum and there is a drain very low on the bottom of the drum for easy emptying of liquids.  The machine does make quite a lot of noise when it is turned on so any extended use would require ear protection.  We are enjoying using this machine...well, as much as we can enjoy having to go out and vacuum the garage almost every day.  At least it is comforting to know that the vacuum is powerful and we can get the job done efficiently and then move on to doing something more interesting. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:13:43	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
29838904	I read the reviews posted on this sander, and they pretty well outlined what to expect.  The Bosch 1276D is heavy and powerful.  It is a perfect addition to my wood work tools as I have a light weight belt sander for the little jobs. Much more sander than what I need, but perfect for the big jobs, and no worry of hurting it for lack of power.  For the price it is better than what I had expected.  Don't get hooked into some of the so called rebuilt-refurbished companies that charge more than the new price.  Cheaper by far than any of the same models that I looked at on Ebay.  If you need a good HEAVY DUTY sander this is the one to pick.  Requires some strong arms to use and control it. The exhaust could have been vented the other direction, but I still give it a 5 star.  Also five stars to the seller for fast shipping-good price and good communication with a UPS tracking number. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:13:43	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

58387862	Great tool!  I've used mine for drilling in concrete and wood - and it works superbly for that - but this weekend I used it to chip out some old floor tile and thinset.  With a 1 1/2 inch chipping bit the old tile didn't stand a chance, and for taking out the thinset, it was particularly awsome.  Key words here are 1) Gets the job done, 2) One tough tool, and 3) Very little vibration.1) After a short learning curve, (Attack tile from the corners and where two tiles meet. Attack thinset at 90 degrees to the trowel grooves.) the tile and thinset basically flew off of there.2) Tough tool.  I ran the tool for about two hours straight before lunch and another two hours straight after lunch with only short breaks to clear debris.  It never even whimpered, and was going as strong at the end as when I started.  I noticed that it got a little warm, (So what did you expect?) and I kept checking it, but it never overheated.  The Bulldog lives up to its name for toughness.3)  Very little vibration.  Of course there is some.  It is a hammer-chipper after all.  However, for the record, the vibration is minimal - far less than my string trimmer, for example.  After four hours working this thing, my hands and arms were never numb.  I was impressed.  You can chip all day and not get beat up!  The Bulldog is also a comfortable dog.The ability to adjust the angle of the bit is a very positive feature.  You can adjust it to what ever angle that is most effective or comfortable.  The Bulldog is fairly light weight too.  It won't wear you out just carrying it around, but it still packs a wallop.As I mentioned, drilling with or without the hammer feature is awsome.  You can set if for drill only, drill and hammer, or hammer only.  This is one 5 star tool!Furthermore, the Bulldog is very moderately priced.  I learned long ago that cheap tools are no bargain - but good tools at a bargain price are!  This is a good tool, and it doesn't cost that much either.  By the way, I had another brand rotary hammer - about the same size - that comes dressed in yellow - sold it.  This Bosch is leagues ahead of that other one.Can it do everything - maybe not, but just about everything.  I do have one of those big elephant-like rotary hammers for the REALLY BIG jobs, but 9 times out of 10, I reach for the Bosch Bulldog - and it gets the job done.By the way - When using this tool or any other rotary hammer, wear safety glasses, a GOOD dust mask, ear muffs, and gloves.  Don't skimp on any of those!  I know there are some macho types out there that think that stuff is for wimps.  Well listen, Bubba - You ain't bullet proof.  The wimps will be out there making money while you are in the emergency room or getting fitted for hearing aids.  Put on the safety gear!  It's extremely important!Good tool - quality tool.  I like it. and I think you will too.06/2004 - Quick edit - I like this tool so much that when the opportunity came along to acquire a used one, I bought it and now have two.  Why?  Just because it is a great tool, and I can have one in the truck and a back-up at home.  JM 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:15:53	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

22971626	I don't quite understand why Dewalt insists on including the utterly worthless sheet metal table extensions.  In the stores, these make this saw look so cheap. And this is definately not a cheaply made saw; overall quality is very high.  I have the sliding cross cut table and use a Vega rip fence instead of the Dewalt fence.  My copy of the DW746 is a joy to use.  I find friendly new features every other time I use it.  My top is dead flat. The sliding cross cut table provides an amazing 26 inches of cross cut capability: great for cabinet makers.  No other saw offers this feature at such a price.  After initial adjustments for precise parallelism and correcting the 90 and 45 degree stops, this saw is dead accurate.  It is used very heavily in my furniture shop with no problems.  (No experience with the Dewalt rip fence.)  Almost unmeasurable runout on the arbor.  Precisely machined arbor shaft.  I ditched the odd 2 inch dust collector and installed 5 inch dust collection underneath the saw. This was surprisingly easy: the mounting holes are pre-drilled. Oh yes, the included cross-cut guide is absolutely wonderful.  I could go on forever.  This saw is worth what they charge for it.  But please, Dewalt, include at least one decent cast top extension.  Ditch the sheet metal.It's 05/19/2009 and the saw is still chugging along nicely.  I am still very pleased with the saw.  After using table saws at several friends shops, this saw is still the king of hybred saws in my opinion.  Well worth the cost.  The slidding table is still dead-on on accurate.  Can't imagine how I ever worked with out it.10/23/2009 -- Looks like the testing people got it right this time.  The DW746 scored at the top in a major woodworking magazine.  Our saw sees heavy use.  The sliding table is excellant and well worth the cost.  By the way, we build large one-off custom furniture and cabinet items.  This saw fits right into our small shop.12/04/2011 -- The saw is still going strong.  Has seen heavy use.  NO problems at all with the supurb sliding cross cut table.  Still five stars!!12/22/2013 -- Looks like Dewalt stopped making these saws.  That is a shame, because with the sliding cross cut table extension installed on the left side, this is one fantastic table saw.  As you can see from the dates above, mine is still in heavy use with no problems.  We trim cabinet doors, large panels, etc. using the sliding table and it is still dead accurate.  That is truly impressive when you consider this thing provides a 26 inch cross cut capability.  No other saw in this price range (new or used!!) can come close.  If you want a durable 10 inch cabinet saw and find one used, buy it.  Dewalt still sells the sliding cross cut table.  It is a worthwhile addition as is the saw in your shop. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:17:57	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

I had the Ingersoll 1215Ti for many years and loved it.  This new one is already down on power, and the head spins free of the body, making it hard to single handed put a socket on a nut in a tight space without the head moving.  Very frustrating.I am a professional technician and have been doing this for many years.  Every other air tool I own is also an Ingersoll, so I am not slamming the brand.

Since I planned to splice on to the upper portion of this post after replacing the bracket, a square cut was essential...which eliminated the use of a chainsaw or a reciprocating saw.  I decided I needed another saw when my old saw just about gave out cutting the two treated rough cut 6 x 6 temporary roof braces.  Needing a new saw right away, I went to the local Lowe's and after comparing their products, I decided on the DeWalt DWE575SB.After kerfing all four sides of the post, I used a reciprocating saw to cut the remaining 3.  By nailing guides on all four sides of the post and ended up with a perfectly square cut.  The DeWalt DWE575SB went through this post like a hot knife through butter...effortlessly.  The saw's light weight was another plus when cutting through a vertical post.My reasons for selecting the DeWalt were 1)I owned DeWalt tools in the past, 2)the maximum depth of cut at 90 degrees (2-9/16), 3)the weight of the saw (8.8#), and 4) the electric brake. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:19:49	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
41573938	This is a dandy cordless grinder/cutoff tool. But don't expect it to replace your corded grinders or cutoff wheel tools. If you lay on it hard it shuts off immediately and you have to restart. You must cut or grind gently, keeping it's RPM's up. Or get out a cord and use a full strength grinder. That said, I'm glad I have one when I just need one cut or a little metal removed from something. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:19:49	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

56631024	I don't know if the reviewers who complained about the noise have ever used an air compressor before but this one is not that loud at all! Also, oilless compressors always take a little more time to pump up a full charge and are louder than oiled machines. And I don't know how one could expect a 2 gallon tank to provide any type of continuous airflow for cleaning, spraying etc. I am a professional woodworker and this lightweight little guy is so perfect for pick-up air nailing work or where a small trim job is needed and I don't want to lug around even a pancake unit. This is a fantastic machine for small nail jobs and inflating things so I don't know what others are expecting. Also, I bought mine brand new on sale from Ha**** Fr***** for $55.00! But even Amazon's price is well worth it. My only tiny complaint is that I wish the max pressure was 120 instead of 100. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:19:49	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

30865298	Very light weight and well made.  The bits are easy and quick to change out.  Plenty of power and batteries seem to last a long time.  It comes with two batteries and a fast battery charger so you shouldn't run out of power.  Also comes with a nice soft sided case.  The only thing I didn't care for was the holster.  It seemed a little cheap, but I probably wouldn't have worn it even if it was top quality so it's not an issue for me. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:20:59	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
37870542	The stapler I received was not a factory reconditioned item.  It was used and clearly had signs of being used.  The case and gun even had the previous owners name wrote on it in permanent marker. It works fine, so I'm not sure why it was returned in the first place.  Maybe they did fix it, but it certainly was not cleaned or were the parts showing wear replaced.  This gun is badly represented on Amazon, I'm very surprised that they would list this gun as factory reconditioned. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:20:59	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
43156647	I excitedly received the combination belt/disc sander with the closed stand.  A great upgrade and addition to my shop.The belt sander works as expected but the disc sander has up to 1/4 inch of lateral run out.  The disc wobbles worse than a bike wheel with a couple of spokes missing.I looked to see if the shaft / keyway / disc mating surface was misaligned - Nope.No adjustment possible so I chalk this one up to poor quality control on the disc run out.Amazon was great.  I called and told them the issue and they promptly sent out another one without even having to return the first one.  I was impressed.  I was also notified that if I didn't return the first one (with disc run out) my credit card would be charged for the second unit, which is only fair.I received the second unit in 2 days.  I opened the box to only find the same issue, just as bad.I contacted Amazon again and they advised to keep both units until they can do an investigation.  The investigation should take about a week.The options at that time will be either to return both units, shipping is paid for and UPS pick up from our home and Amazon issues a full refund, or they ship a new unit that has been verified to run true and ship back the two defective units.This is where I am at.  Stay tuned.Amazon also gave me the Jet Tool number to call and discuss the issue with them and see if they can rectify the issue.Follow up is supposed to be in a week.  I will post another review after this.Amazon has been great, but you can't cover up poor quality or a missed critical inspection station.I expected more from Jet as all the other Jet tools in my shop work fine. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:20:59	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
29206321	This tool does the job, but it has a constant stream of air venting from the top of the tool (not the air hose connection) that makes the compressor run constantly.

40019324	I am in the custom home systems integration business.  This saw is one of the best, if not the best tool in my van.  A Sawsall is great for bigger jobs, but for cutting speakers holes or outlet boxes into drywall this is the best.  (A RotoZip makes too much dust and is hard to control.) Drywall dust from cutting ceiling speaker holes eats them up and I have to change the grease 3 or 4 time to extend the life of the saw, but I still buy them.  I used to get them for $75.  Now they are twice that.  It could be because I think they are or will be discontinued soon.  Nothing out there like it.  I hope my order goes through for 1 more. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:22:33	No Defect		Expert	No		false

143516	If you are in the market for a new impact driver, please take a look at this tool.  First off, I am not a professional, I am an advanced DIY type and build most of the projects in my home, my brothers farm and volunteer.  I have owned this for about two months now.  I checked the review on a tool review site and figured I would try it out.  I have owned the following 18v Impact Drivers: Dewalt 18v XRP Lithium, Dewalt 20v (I know not an 18v) Lithium, Milwaukee M18 both compact and XC, Makita BTD 141, 142 and LXFD01 Brushless, Bosch 18v Lithium.  My least favorites were the Dewalts however they are quality tools, I am just not a big Dewalt fan.  I buy and sell tools to keep my woodshop well stocked so I come into contact with many tools.On to the driver...First off, this tool has a brushless motor which increses power and longevity. The tool is resplendant in heavy rubber overmold. The tool uses an optical trigger (seriously, this is a good thing, triggers go all the time).  The tool has 4 speeds!  You can adjust the amount of impacts to full time or just enought to get a fastener into the wood - Awesome! There is an LED Headlamp which you manually turn on and off and a battery gauge.  The tool has up to 1420 lbs of torque, 3200 BPMs and 2600 RPMs.  Honestly this tool is an incredible piece of equipment that will last a long time and more than perform.  Take the time to look over reviews and video reviews, you cannot go wrong with this impact gun. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:23:22	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

23014457	I'm a professional woodworker; I've owned this tool for 4 years.  I use this thing every day, 5 days a week.  The plastic frame seemed a little light when I bought it, but I bolted it to a workbench right away, and it's been a champ.  It's really handy for sanding in those hard to reach places that would be real finger breakers (of which there are many in my work; I'm a luthier). The table top is metal, and feels pretty solid enough.  Before this I used those sanding drums that mounted to a drill press; this is a LOT better. It leaves a cleaner finish and it easier to use, it's also nice to have a dedicated tool permanently set up for this task.  Highly recommended. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:25:12	No Defect		Expert	No		false

The battery on my unit also began leaking and it corroded the connections in the motor section just after the warranty expired.  I would recommend buying a more powerful and better made dremel, even if you intend to use it for dog nail trimming, with the hope that it will last longer.While it still worked, I found it very useful, and my dog liked it better than the nail clippers.

36807448	Really quite a nice cordless power drill.  It's small but has enough power to handle most home projects.  I've used it to drill holes in wood and drive screws on several wood working units.  The battery holds out for quite a while.  It is lithium, however, it is not detachable, and it takes some time to recharge.  Therefore, it will be necessary to recharge it at every opportunity.There is a screwdriver bit that attaches to the lower end.  It is very easy to dislodge it, so I reccommend it be taped over or stored seperately to avoid loss.The price is so very nominal that I advise buying two of them.  Using two together allows two seperate bits to be used at once and gives backup power in case one battery dies.  I found this to be invaluable while working on various wood projects that required two or more size drills.All in all, this is a very useful tool that I find myself using more than I thought I would.  It is well made and durable.  It should last for many years. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:33:50	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

Though it does take some time to cover a large surface.Drawbacks -- the cord is kind of short -- but that's easily remedied with an extension cord, and you probably wouldn't want a super long cord on such a small appliance.  My other gripe-- the little polishing bonnets were pretty hard to get on and off.

51004998	I put this guy to the test with a project that should have been beyond it's limits and it performed like a star!  Unable to remove the finish from some 85 yr old oak flooring by sanding or scraping, this planer saved the day.  In a pinch, I actualy planed about 500 sq feet of oak flooring (in place) with this unit - a task greater than what it was designed for I'm guessing.  Probably 40 hours of actual use on that project and the planer just kept going.  Now, I did go through about a dozen blades in that process, but this planer (and my knees) took the beating and saved a now beautiful old floor.

43698945	This planer is probably the heaviest tool in my workshop, it took 2 people to get it out of the truck without it being dropped. The first month I had it, it left a finish smoother than I could get with sandpaper. But after that first month or so, the blades got fairly dull, and I have been too cheap to replace them, so I've just sanded the boards that come out. But when I got it, the extension tables were almost perfectly set to the planer, I didn't even adjust the blades, and it was perfect. So if you don't mind having to sharpen or replace blades every month or so, you will love this planer. 	trangp	10-19-2015 21:39:46	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
51161479	This is the drill I was looking for so long. I had gone t HD to buy a dewalt drill and they were too expensive. Now I found this drill for $120.00 at Amazon, I already put it to use. I built a shelf 9'x7' 4 levels made out of wood. Solid shelf. One battery lasted almost for the entire job. But this drill comes with two; so while you use one, have the other one charging.I recommend it! 	rgruss	10-19-2015 22:01:00	No Defect		Expert	No		true

45614859	Well built all around!  Solid feel yet lightweight for an 18V system.  Silently delivers torque and speed.  The grip and rubberized body ergonomics are just about perfect.  These Li-Ion batteries last FOREVER!!!  And having a backup driver is almost SINFUL.  This combo replaces a 15yr old Makita Ni-Cad system...only because of battery obolesence.  Makita has never disappointed and continues to deliver.Be advised the charger is a GIGUNDOUS beast (apparently there's a memory chip in the batts that the charger uses to determine optimal usage and charge rates...sucker even has a cooling fan).  Consequently the hard case is a bit oversized...but do not let this deter from the performance.The LED lights are icing on the cake.  Even the belt clips have come in handy...who knew?For those that do their homework - Check the specs and you'll see this unit is superior to the competition.Nothing but love for Makita! 	rgruss	10-19-2015 22:01:00	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

Been a roofer for 15 years, paslode,makita, and bostich, this gun leaves them in the dust as far as a money maker. The main thing is to oil the gun,keep it clean, and adjust the psi high enough. 	rgruss	10-19-2015 22:02:15	No Defect		Expert	No		true
22307049	This Saw is as advertised:  Light and Powerful.  Primarily used by me for tree pruning as well as the odd-job, this saw makes quick work of whatever it's up against.  As a current owner of the M18 drill, this #34;Bare-Tool#34; version of the Sawzall was an absolute bargain.  Does not ship with case, charger or battery- as you should obviously be aware.  Also, too be ready for your job with the appropriate blade and this saw will not let you down.  Decent life on a fully charged battery, good balance, comfortable grip and a sturdy, quick-changing blade lock make this a great choice.  Milwaukee invented the Sawzall and still makes the best. 	rgruss	10-19-2015 22:02:15	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

22882323	To use the router compass you have to first drill holes slightly over sized and counter-sunk into it so you can attach it to your router.  IT DOES NOT COME PRE-DRILLED.  I would have never ordered this if I had know that.  Of course the lexan (polycarbonate resin thermoplastic) is only 1/4 thick so any attempt to counter-sink this will most-likely end in failure - there is no margin for error - leaving you with a worthless overpriced piece of plastic.  I should have returned it the second I pulled it out of the package.  Don't waste your time. 	rgruss	10-19-2015 22:02:15	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
89742514	I am a young guy just married and settled into our first house so I needed some new power tools had some older ones that worked for the projects I had when renting an apt. in a city(not much area for building things) I have always like to build and fix things possibly why I became and engineer. I went back and forth between Milwaukee Tool and Dewalt and the more I looked and price as well as pros and cons from contractor friends and mechanic friends one of them said why do you need pro-grade tools yes they work great and last a long time but he said why dont I save some money and look at like black and decker they are lower cost and work fantasic for what I need. So for Christmas my father in law got us the 20v matrix (I say us because my wife and I build and do projects together she also enjoys it) I have used the Drill, Router, cutoff saw and Impact so far on a recent build and they all worked great) the battery has a good life to it ( I did buy a 2nd battery right away though may not have needed it after using it but nice to have) I would highly recommend this for any DIY person. surely I would not build a house with this even a big deck might be a bit too much for it that I would borrow something better from a friend. but its a great tool at a great price. 	rgruss	10-19-2015 22:02:15	No Defect		Novice	No		true

55811912	As a proffesional contractor who relies on my tools to feed my family I have to say this tool is a winner.  I was introduced to it by a finish carpenter who had been using one he got as a gift.  It has almost replaced my regular heavy 18v drill.  the hex bits work great, but beware of breaking them easily.  Also the hex drill bits can not be resharpened easily.  Between this tool and the Dewalt 7.2v screwdriver, I have gone from using my big 18v drill daily to less than weekly.  I love this tool for setting and removing tapcon screws in concrete!!! nothing is better!!  I also discovered that by placing a soft brass rotarly brush in it, it is a wonderful tool to cleen off wood, concrete, and sidding.  I used to have my assistant clean the concrete splatters off of sidding until I discovered this.  Now instead of taking the better part of a hour to clean a porch, it is done in less than 10 minutes and usually less than 5.  Time is money and this tool saves time in a big way.  The only major downside is the cost of hex accesories and the quality of them.  You will definitely get what you pay for in them, so don't scrimp and buy the cheapies.  Especially screwdriver bits, they break too easy and you'll just end up going through them faster.  I highly recomend using square drive screws with this tool. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 22:41:07	No Defect		Expert	No		false
34949937	After examining several top table saws, the Bosch is by far the best on  the market.  The soft-start feature is great, all adjustments are easy to  make, and very solid once they are made.

37777386	I've used this guy for about a month on a siding project, and it's worked very nicely.  It is indeed much quieter than most, but still keeps up with my coil nailer.  I haven't tried it with two nailers at once; that might push it a bit, but I can't say for sure.As another poster mentioned, the manual does a poor job of telling you how to break-in.  Be sure to fill with oil and install the air filter before starting.Only negative comment is the same as many others mentioned; poor packaging design resulted in the unloading elbow getting snapped off in shipping.  It required drilling out the check valve, retapping the threads, buying an equivalent part at the hardware store, and reinstalling.  Serious PITA, but cost was minimal and repair works fine.All in all, a great little compressor, and the best choice if noise is a concern. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 22:49:56	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

I have owned other Senco nailers and never really liked them, preferring at the time Hitachi or Duo-fast, however this gun is much better and I'm happy with it.

39619436	One of the smartest purchases I've ever made. The 14 volt setup more than meets my needs for home handyman work. The drill handles well and has a lot of torque, and  the light has saved my bacon twice already. But the showstopper is the impact driver, which buries tough screws easily in hard to get at spaces. I'm so pleased with this kit that I'm selling a nice 18 volt drill/saw kit which is now excess.One negative remark: the impact driver needs a bit which is indented so the collar can hold it. While there is a supplied bit for the drill, there is not a supplied bit for the impact driver.

Cutting wood goes very slow (or the blade will overheat and dull really fast). As far as cutting a nail you can probably cut one but trying to cut more is a no-go since the blade wares out with the first cut.

23820089	I used this sander to refinish the pine floor in our cabin followed by a Waterlox finish.  It is beautiful.  This sander has good weight (for doing a floor) and seems quite well built.  No downward pressure is required, just hold onto it so it doesn't go off to the races.  With a floor, I would look at this as the minimum sander required.  A dedicated floor sander that costs thousands of dollars would be better.  The realty is that because of the weight, this may be the only time I use the sander.  (I still saved a lot of money by doing it myself.)  I doubt many other sanders of this type would do as well.  I found 120 Grit sandpaper to be the best on my application.  In places I started with 80 Grit, but it just meant more work re-sanding later with the 120.  I rigged a hose to my shop vac and that really helped (it has a bag).  You have to unclog the channel that takes up the sawdust from time to time, mainly because there's a lot of sawdust. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:01:43	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

And you can actually put your hands on it at The Big Box Store.I love competition! Let's see how this effects it. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:04:08	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

41833699	Recieved product quickly and all was in good condition but after using only about 2 months the batteries do not hold a charge. Batteries last about 30 min. I am very disappointed in the Milwaukee quality. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:04:08	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
27442754	I agree with some of the other reviewers that this isn't up to much as a drill, but it was just what I needed in an electric screwdriver and I wasn't looking for another drill. It feels good in the hand, the buttons are intuitive to use, it comes with some decent driver heads, and the LED light is awesome for dark closets. I keep the clutch on a fairly high setting for removing old screws otherwise it gives up rather sooner than I would like, but all in all, a great buy. I give four stars instead of five because the tape measure isn't there (the symbol indicating that there is one is on the handle, but perhaps I bought a model that doesn't have one.) 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:04:44	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
37456155	I bought this a WHILE back and it arrived in a very smashed and damaged box.  Looked like it was used and repacked.  Anyways, i have a small machine shop so I figured I could bend out the pieces to make it work.  I opened the entire product and after unpacking it realized it did not have any instructions or bolts/screws with it.  I contacted the seller and asked to ship me one, as I thought I was doing them a favor and keeping the damaged product, just need some guidance to put this thing together.  Never received one or any emails back.  So now I still have a pile of parts that are pretty much useless.  I work 70 hours a week so time is a luxury with me, and this is quite a rip off.  Buyer beware!!!!!!  There is so many pieces in this product that it would take 2 hours on a easy day with the instructions!!!!! 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:04:44	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
22749034	I don't think I'll ever go back to a manual stapler unless I don't have access to an air compressor.  This one costs just about the same as a manual stapler.  it is nice and light and easy to maneuver and fire rapidly. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:04:44	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

40731197	The only problem I've had with this is that the spring that pushes the nails up gets caught sometimes and won't go up.

59323741	I ordered this router in January from Amazon. They said it was in stock at the time.  After a month they said it was back ordered. After four months they cancelled my order.  I was willing to wait for the item since the reviews were very good. I tried to get Amazon to re-instate the order so I wouldn't lose my place in line. Knowing it would be in stock at some point I thought Amazon would be reasonable about this.  NOTHING DOING. They were jerks. Shipments from the distributor are just starting up again.  I'll be curious to see what happens.  I think a high number of loyal customers are likely to get screwed again. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:06:17	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
43969020	This is a fantastic saw.  The manufacturer's comments say it all, but the most important thing they mention is the lower guides.  Having these guides close to the underside of the bottom of the table allows for tight turns and better tracking on straight cuts.  The competition doesn't have this type of guide -- only Delta.Also, this saw has a super-heavy trunnion underneath it -- heavier than the quot;you know who'squot; saw with it's aluminum trunnion.If you are interested in doing some resawing, get the riser kit.  Then, pair the saw up with some of those low-tension Swedish steel blades that are so popular and you can run a 3/4quot; blade on it with no problem.  I don't think the saw would properly tension a 3/4quot; blade unless you seek out these low tension blades, however.  With the riser kit and these blades, this is a fantastic saw for resawing, and it's made even better by the super-adjustable features of the fence that's included.I've done a lot of cutting on my saw, and I'm extremely pleased with it.  Unless you're prepared to spend nearly twice as much, I don't think you'll beat it! 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:06:17	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
55580344	Once again, another hit from Makita.  I use this router bench mounted so I can't comment on the plunge attachment but for bench work, this tool is great.  My original router was a Hitachi that had the bearings wear out (probably my fault for not property adjusting the RPM).  This tool is very powerful and great for routing harder woods with its variable speed control.  The in bench height adjustment is so so, but you can still accurately set it with some tinkering.  I have run many hardwood raised panel cabinet doors through this tool and it has no issues with the larger diameter bits. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:06:17	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

35610487	Received the 16 gauge angled finish nailer as a gift recently.  Worked at first, then began to misfire with increasing frequency.  Recharged batteries and new fuel cells don't help.  Will have to take it to the service center soon, but from the other reviews I've read, I am not holding out much hope of a fix.I don't know the circumstances of folks who claim that their guns work, but Paslode is obviously seling a significant number of guns that don't work.  It beats me why anyone would want to roll the dice on this device when a reliable alternative (i.e., pneumatic nail gun) is available.  With such a high number of defective guns sold already, has there been a product liability class action of any sort initiated yet?  This device is clearly not fit for its intended use. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:07:49	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
43789995	I got this because of the advertised 60db noise level. Well believe it, it is the quietest shop vac I have ever had. It has 6 wheels around the perimeter instead of 4, a very long hose that is very flexible, it has 5 different motor speeds so you can adjust it to the desired suction. The lower the motor speed the quieter it is. At it's highest speed, you can still hear the radio at it normal volume. No need for earplugs with this machine. And a bonus for me is something I've never had before, a tool setting so it will automatically turn on and off with the tool you are using. I was dreading the $280 I spent on it, but now I don't mind at all. Definitely a well acceptable replacement for my old craftsman shop vac. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:07:49	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
36461324	I have to agree with the other reviews I have read on this site. It is a cute toy, but not well made.  It works sometimes and then not others.  My son also dropped it and the nozzle part broke off and can not be fixed.  I found the beads inside to be dangerous.  I have it duct taped back on.  It is also very loud.  It would be a great toy  if it were more durable. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:07:49	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes	Is both a performance and safety defect	false
23557426	I dont use it everyday, but I've had it for 5 years and it never failed (except once when I was using it as an icebreaker and it came apart),but it snapped backed together and kept on truckin. I always expect the batteries to die,but they go on forever!  The grip isn't very ergonomic, but I put up with it. Great deal. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:09:49	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
26415443	As with many products these days, this thing is geared to the lowest common denominator imbecile. There is a safety tab on the end that must be depressed against the item to be stapled, or it will not fire. Apparently they don't want an amateur to staple their finger, and assume everyone is an idiot. Thus, when using it in tight places, it's worthless. Then when you are finally graced with a fire, the staples will not penetrate deep enough, even in soft wood. I used it for re clothing a pool table, and it took 4 times the usual time because I had to fight the stapler. My fault, I knew better, I should have sprung for a professional stapler that would work well and last, so I guess I have to pay the price for trying to save a few bucks. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:09:49	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

58431207	Three full seasons of the year either my husband or I have to use a shop vac to get leaves and other natural debris out of our garage.  We keep the door to the garage open all day because that is our easiest access into the house, but this is also allowing all kinds of things to blow in the garage and potentially become a hazard.  The old vacuum we have been using for years finally gave up the pitiful little bit of suction it came with and had become nothing more than something sitting in the corner.  We are both very well pleased with our new Workshop wet/dry vac.The instruction manual which comes with the vacuum is adequate because only the casters and caster covers actually need to be assembled.  The caster covers have indentations where you can park the utility pieces like extra nozzles and extension wands plus there are four more indentations on the top of the 16 gallon capacity unit.  The pleated paper filter for dry vacuuming is already installed and can be used for a very small amount of liquid pick-up.  Any large amount of liquid removal will necessitate you installing a different filter made specifically for wet material removal.  That wet filter is not included with the unit and a visit to the product website shows the filter will cost around $22 extra.  The 12 gallon unit can be used with the included dust bag, but that option is not available on the 16 gallon unit.  By moving the hose to the exhaust port you can use the vacuum as a blower.  There are three attachments: utility nozzle, wet nozzle, and car nozzle plus two extension wands.  The car nozzle is really quite handy to have and we have used it along with the basic utility nozzle.  Included also is something called a locking sleeve (a rubber type tube) to add extra strength in accessory connections.  Wow, would I ever love to be able to watch a video of how in heck that thing is supposed to be utilized.  Maybe I should have gone looking to see if there is a YouTube video?  We finally gave up and resorted to our tried-and-true method for keeping the sections of extra wands and hose connected.This is a wet/dry vacuum with a great deal of power.  It definitely lives up to the description of high capacity.  The unit is made in Mexico with the instruction manual written in English, Spanish, and French.  The casters roll very smoothly so it is easy to pull the vacuum along with you as you work.  The hose snaps securely to the inlet of the vac and detaches simply by pressing on the red release.  There is an on/off red toggle switch.  Removing the top completely is the way to empty the drum and there is a drain very low on the bottom of the drum for easy emptying of liquids.  The machine does make quite a lot of noise when it is turned on so any extended use would require ear protection.  We are enjoying using this machine...well, as much as we can enjoy having to go out and vacuum the garage almost every day.  At least it is comforting to know that the vacuum is powerful and we can get the job done efficiently and then move on to doing something more interesting. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:09:49	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

It works perfectly on anything that I have thrown at it. The first time I brought it out at my new job people didn't know what to think. Every one of them has tried it and loved it. Some were just passing the tool around and amazed that the thing would fire nails into thick molding. I guess they thought you needed air pressure to be able to do some of that. The price of this gun when bought new might keep most of them away, but I have been helping my crew mates to find deals on it so they aren't asking to use mine. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:12:25	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

36515151	As I stare at my box full of old cordless drills and their depleted NiCad batteries, I can only wish that this drill was available much earlier. After retiring my DeWalts and Makita's and realizing that there is no shame in using an extension cord, I vowed never to throw money away again at a cordless and their overpriced NiCad batteries.Forced into a job site with no power, I purchased this drill from Amazon at a good price and put it through its paces with a variety of drill loads. Some specifics:1) The first impression has to be its small size, weight, quality of feel, balance. Obvious quality of materials and manufacturing.2)The chuck has to be the best that I have ever used. Easiest to change bits, extremely tight grip on both small (1/16) and large bits. Outstanding engineering concept and achievement.3) Speed control has two ranges and mesh perfectly from slow driver speed to fast drilling. Excellent trigger feel and response.4) And now the power. Don't even think of stalling this brute. The 3.5AH NiMH batteries have incredible reserve and recharge capablity. The charger is well designed and will quickly charge a depleted battery. These batteries seem to last all day.If you are thinking of a (the) top quality cordless drill that will last for many years and handle any job, this is the obvious choice. Well worth the cost, which is price competitive with the other 15-18v drill selections.You deserve this !! 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:13:20	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

I looked at the new DeWalt 3 x 21 sander  don't care for the weight or balance of it.This Rigid belt sander soft-start takes a little getting used to, but the tool works great.

The price was slightly higher than what it would cost to rent a SDS drill but I figured after the cost of driving to and from the rental store, it would be a wash.

30911461	My existing grinders all run about 10,000 RPM. This grinder is compact and runs at 4500 RPM (so it won't overrev the pads), and has a standard 5/8-11 grinder thread. Very light weight and comfortable. Comes with a guard, screw-in side handle and an extra set of brushes. Motor is not labeled. Can't use the guard when polishing, but it's there nonetheless.Comes with seven, 4 diameter Velcro-backed polishing pads that attach to a supplied adapter that screws onto the grinder:50 grit -- rough cut if surface is really rough100 grit -- rough cut200 grit -- start with this if surface is already smooth; will remove big scratches400 grit -- removes small scratches800 grit -- surface should shine after this pad1500 grit -- using pads above 800 should be done after application of densifier (see below); surface should reflect now3000 grit -- final finish. If done right, it says the stone should look wet.There are three different adapters available, depending on the surface shape. Some are flexible, others are rigid. The adapter that came with the kit is sort of both -- semi-rigid.Per the info sheet, all dry grinding steps should use a light, circular motion, like waxing a car with a buffer. New diamonds appear on the pads as they wear down.Applying too much pressure will throw off diamonds before their useful life is over. Also, too much pressure will build up too much heat and melt the rock surface. Not good, apparently. One reason most polishing is done with water cooling.More info at [...]It says dry polishingis very aggressive and needs a light touch and under-5000 RPM speeds, unless (per instructions) polishing softer limestone such as marble or travertine you'll need to run the pads at lower speed or add soapy water to the surface to avoid color transfer.Will give it a try to edge polish a small granite slab after I cut the slab to size.It also comes with two bags of powder. The larger bag is the densifier. Per the included info sheet around 11 oz of this sugar-like powder is mixed with a quart of deionized or purified drinking water and becomes corrosive -- wear gloves and eye protection. It can be stored in a heavy duty polyethylene (PE) bottle. I assume you need to keep all metal away for long term storage. No metal jar caps.The other smaller pouch of chalky powder is for filling pores and top curing. A gallon of solution is made up adding just a teaspoon of this powder to a gallon of tap water, letting the solution settle, and then using only the clear solution on top, adding more water as needed.The densifier is squeegeed onto the surface and allowed to set overnight under a plastic cover so it won't dry out as it forms a gel. The plastic dropcloth keeps CO2 out during the process and to keep it damp. The gel bonds with the aggregates and hardens the surface so a higher sheen can be achieved.The other solution is used to fill in gaps and will bond with the densifier.Obviously, there's more to polishing granite than meets the eye. 	winp0007	10-20-2015 23:15:46	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

I wasn't sure how I would like the angled ergonomics but in use, I haven't really even noticed it.I would recommend this purchase. 	muellerp	10-21-2015 01:49:49	No Defect		Expert	No	Expert because he is used terms like "angled ergonomics".	false
33123680	great tool second one I purchased they work great. They are limited to the size pipe you can cut 2 inch diameter pipe but it says that in the details. Cuts  like a charm clean smooth lightweight I also have a corded Dewalt that cuts 5 inch diameter for larger work.

60251889	I am more than trilled that I purchased this gun. I am renovating an 1813 house in Maine and with all of the framing invoved this tool has been a god send. My only problem has been locating 22 degree nails in the home centers. I had to go to a contractors supply store to get them. That aside, I would buy this tool again in a heartbeat. It has all the power needed to drive into the old timbers in my structure and after over a thousand nails it still has yet to jam.

85769849	I received the Max Gyro as a gift for my birthday and liked it so much I bought one for all my friends.  Intuitive use makes it easy to use one hand and it is much lighter than any cordless drill used as a screwdriver.  I am satisfied with the torque and the LED light makes it easy to find screws in dark crevices.  I have used in building three sets of shelves and permanent wooden baby gates for the bar in our house and have been very happy to have it.The only drawback to it is that it doesn't have storage built into the unit for both the phillips and flat head bits.  The recepticle on the unit is shallow and won't accept a two sided bit (one with flathead on one side and phillips on the other) so you will need to have access to both bits. 	muellerp	10-21-2015 01:49:49	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
36631570	I'm using the press to drill home-etched PCB's. It works well.  Using the drill before etching, however, there is a bit of slippage.  Maybe 1/20th of an inch.

55989885	I am not a carpenter or woodworker but am a bit handy around the house and this saw is perfect for me. Great for occasional work and light duty cutting.Let me cover a few points.First off it has good heft to it. Thats a big thing for me. You can often tell the quality of a power tool by its weight and this one has good weight. It is solid in your hands.Secondly it has a quick changer for the saw blades which is a big plus. You just turn and pop the old blade out and then push the new blade right in. This is a great feature and I really like it.Right out of the box I inserted the battery and ran off ten cuts of 2x3's and it was sharp, fast and neat with no stalling or issues with power. I am thinking the lithium ion battery technology is probably pretty good.Two speeds and a locking position. Which is really nice. I like how it doesn't have one of those buttons you have to press in order to pull the trigger. Just move it out of lock position and it is ready to trigger.Plus: It comes with a very nice cloth bag for storage and quick carrying.Overall it is a very nice saw, probably just for occasional to medium use and simpler projects because it is battery operated. But who knows, maybe it can take some heavier duty use. I am very happy with it.I also included a picture of that blade quick release. 	muellerp	10-21-2015 01:57:49	No Defect		Novice	No		false
29429610	I am using this on a remodel and so far love it, I loaned it to a co-worker first impression for him was WOW that is the good one. has a very powerful motor I used it for drywall, ceramic tiles, duct work, also cut wood and metal etc... so far my favorite is the diamond wheel, that will cut through anything.The only downside to this is when cutting with the wood blade the wrench does not get in there to loosen the nut at the right angle and it marred the edges of the nut, also the nut tightened up through use making it more difficult to remove. 	muellerp	10-21-2015 01:57:49	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

45664588	I am fairly picky and actually had both the Lamello and the Dewalt side by side to see if the latter was worth the extra. The DeWalt's fence is quicker to adjust, and is probably fine for many applications, but there was some noticeable play, and the Lamello had absolutely none. Also, the Dewalt fence is not quite as versatile, but requires less set-up. What convinced me to mail the DeWalt back and not the Lamello is that when cutting, the Lamello never skidded even when messing around with just one hand.. The Dewalt did skid some unless I paid attention to what I was doing. Also, the Lamello has a clutch, and cuts very smoothly, quietly, and is made with a significantly more metal than DeWalt. It is easy to see why it costs more. While I am sure people can do a fine job with even the least expensive model out there, the Lamello gives you quite a bit more for the extra money. 	muellerp	10-21-2015 02:01:05	No Defect		Expert	No		false

55858894	I bought this saw to do about 2500 sq/ft of hardwood flooring and it performed really well. I've used it on almost every job since and it's performed flawlessly.I have also had the issue with the rack and pinion gears popping out and putting the fence out of alignment, just as mentioned in other reviews. This happens to mine every time it goes for a ride in the back of the truck. However, this is really not a big deal to correct and takes less than 15 seconds with no tools required. The gears are spring loaded and the rack has enough movement to jump out of alignment during shipping or when you move the saw in a vehicle. I just manually realign the fence by eye and then make sure the teeth on both rack gears are engaged with their respective fence teeth and you're ready to go.Portability and the half sheet rip capacity is the reason to own this saw, but when cutting sheet goods a bigger in-feed and out-feed table would really help. Of course just as other reviewers have stated you can easily make some out of scrap. Also, forget the blade guard it's not worth the time to install.Just like many others have said the blade that comes with it is fine for basic carpentry, but not suited for any kind of fine work.Overall a solid value vs. competitive saws, if I had it to do over I would buy the version on Amazon with the out-feed table and extra blade since that really is a better deal.UPDATE: I just bought the Bosch portable table saw stand which comes pre-drilled for the Dewalt (Good thinking Bosch)... AWESOME. Check the reviews on the Bosch stand. I consider this the must have upgrade for portablity and it's so much sturdier than the Dewalt stand. Not to mention it rolls:) 	muellerp	10-21-2015 02:02:45	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

55036078	The LED lights are essentially useless, just a gimmick. The spark and eye shields just get in the way of doing anything, you would be much better off with a pair of goggles or safety glasses. Unit seems fairly powerful but it will slow somewhat with heavy pressure. Would be nice if it came with one stone and one wire brush instead of two stones but that would probably add a little to the cost. It seems to be well balanced and runs smoothly, very little vibration or tendency to #34;walk#34; and I do not even have it secured to the bench. Remains to be seen how long it will last but for now I say, for the price, you could do a lot worse. 	muellerp	10-21-2015 02:02:45	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

26709256	It had been many years since I last used a recipro saw, but I can't say my 'fascination' with them ebbed any during that time.  While working to repair the framing of the 10 year old deck on my house, I finally saw (yuk yuk) a clear need for buying one for myself: breaking ~50 nails free from the deck's joists.  After this particular project, my needs for the saw would be occasional but I value quality in my tools b/c that usually equates to longevity -- and I wanted a saw that would be ready to go 15+ years from now.  Shopping around, I basically saw the market as being: 1) ~$100 saws that had an on-off switch only and no counterbalancing; and, 2) $150+ saws that gave the user more control over the cut.  Purely for demolition work, buying a $100 on/off saw makes a lot of sense . . . use it ruthlessly until it fails and then replace it pretty inexpensively.  But with me valuing quality/longevity and needing the flexibility to cover projects I couldn't yet anticipate, I wanted counterbalancing for more accurate cuts, I wanted power to cover different potential needs and I wanted to be able to control the stroke speed more than just by a variable pressure trigger.This led me to the Super Sawzall 15amp.  I looked at the competing Makita but online reviews suggested some owner dissatisfaction.  Considering Milwaukee's reputation in the recipro market and its 5 year warranty, I bought the Super Sawzall 15amp.Using the saw for the deck project was amazing.  The power got me through 8d exterior nails in just seconds.  The tool is easy to hold and line-up for the cut.  I didn't find the weight to be an issue as some have commented, the saw feels fairly well balanced in my hands.  And speaking of balance, this counterbalanced saw doesn't feel at all like a jackhammer that wants to jump out of your hands (like I remember the early Sawzall being).  Using this one is about as complicated as using a power drill -- only if you're clumsy/distracted will you end up with a botched outcome.  The storage case is well designed, not larger than it needs to be and includes plenty of room for blades of various lengths.  (Note: I have not yet tried orbital cuts with this saw, so I cannot comment on that performance.)A key consideration in buying this corded 15amp saw -- or any 15amp power tool -- is your extension cord.  Drawing 15amps, you need a heavy gauge extension cord to be working an appreciable distance away from your power source.  At this writing, a 10 gauge, 100' extension cord is ~$100 so you may need to figure this cost into your purchase consideration.Bottom line: I'm impressed with the build quality, control and power of this saw.  I look forward to moving rapidly through future home projects and then one day passing the saw to my son. 	muellerp	10-21-2015 02:10:30	No Defect		Expert	No		false

52859165	I was all ready to purchase the Fein Multi-Master Pro kit with the profile-sanding accessory until I found out that they are changing to an improved four-slot mounting system later this year because of a blade slippage problem. Fein has already changed all of their accessories to this new design, and even though they have an adapter available to retrofit their current tool to this new style mount, for what this kit costs, I wasn't going to pay top dollar for what is essentially already an outdated product. I will wait until later this year to purchase one when the tool with the new style mount is available.In the meantime, I purchased a rebuilt single speed PC 9444 online for twenty-nine dollars from Tools-Plus. It looked like new and if it weren't for the letter R stamped on the back of it, you would never know the difference.The first thing I did when I got this sander was to wash the rubber profile blocks and profile mounting pads with a sponge in hot soapy water to remove the slippery powder coating that came on them from the factory. So far, I haven't had any problems with the profile blocks popping out during use.I have used it mainly to do detail sanding for furniture refinishing, such as the corners of raised panels, fine crevices on turned table legs and bedposts, after first using a stripper and scraper to remove as much of the old finish as possible.The sander is good at cleaning out those little spaces that normally require lots of tedious hand sanding with homemade profile blocks and sandpaper folded over the tip of a stiff putty knife. The PC 9444 uses an inline motion, so a final hand sanding is still necessary for a smooth finish. With the profile blocks, I use this tool with only two paper grits, #80 or #120, because I found that grits heavier than #80 disintegrate and leave a lousy scratch pattern, while grits finer than #120 wear out way too fast, leading to either shiny spots or paper burn through and the nasty black rubber marks several other reviewers have noted. By the way, Tools-Plus sells the Porter-Cable brand 4.5 inch X 10 yard PSA rolls for less than fifteen dollars. I can usually get enough for three profile-sanding sheets from one 2.5-inch wide strip. If you buy the optional PSA diamond pad for the PC 9444, you can cut your own PSA diamond sanding sheets for use without dust collection [because of no holes in the pad or sanding sheet]. The little hook  loop diamond pads [with the holes in them for dust collection] come in five packs and are expensive at almost three dollars per pack, so I try not to use them unless I absolutely need to for dust collection purposes.The only thing I don't care for about the kit is that there is absolutely no extra storage space in the case. Not even for a handful of the little diamond sanding sheets. Speaking of which, there aren't any sanding sheets included with the rebuilt kit. I also had to purchase several additional items to maximize this sanders functionality, such as, the PSA diamond mounting pad, the shutter offset mounting pad and the dust collector wand.Overall, considering the performance and for what I paid for this kit, I think it was a very good value. If you are leery of trying this tool because of all the bad reviews on Amazon's site, a rebuilt tool may be the way to go. If it doesn't work out for you, at only twenty-nine dollars, you can afford to toss it. 	muellerp	10-21-2015 02:10:30	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes	Perofmance defect because customer found a few small issues that seemed to be significant enough.	false

32691193	The Wilton 17202 is a fantastic, high quality machine.  Don't let the few negative comments in other reviews sway you away from this bench grinder.  Yes, the light is a little dim, so what.  Yes, there may me a slight vibration that you can adjust for, so what (I can barely detect a vibration in mine).  Some people had washers installed backwards, so turn them around.  This grinder gets up to speed quickly and takes a LONG time to come to a complete stop (I think this is a mark of quality).I narrowed my choices down to this model and the 8 DeWALT.  I'm VERY glad I purchased the Wilton.  The Wilton costs a little more (roughly $155 compared to $123) BUT, it's more than worth it - here's why:The Wilton is extremely easy to change the grinding wheels on, the DeWALT is very cumbersome to change the wheels on.The Wilton has permanently lubricated bearings, the DeWALT needs to have the bearings periodically lubricated by a service center (an ongoing expense to keep the DeWALT running properly).The Wilton has a much more powerful motor, (7.7 amps for the Wilton compared to 4 amps for the DeWALT).The Wilton includes a wheel dressing tool, the DeWALT doesn't.  Purchasing a dressing tool will cost about $20.00.Wilton and JET are part of the same company.  JET makes even higher quality bench grinders (for a lot more money), and they most likely share technology.  Not sure if the Wilton is a re-badged JET with some changes - I'm speculating here, but I wouldn't be surprised.The Wilton has thumb screws that make it easy to adjust the tool rest distance, tool rest angle (on the 17202), and eye guards.  I don't believe the DeWALT has thumb screws.After factoring in all of these items, the Wilton comes out on top.The sound of the Wilton is great.  It sounds extremely powerful, yet quiet and smooth running (you need to hear it to fully appreciate this).  It was also well packed in the factory styrofoam inside the factory box.  If there is any damage upon arrival, it is most likely due to severe mis-handling by the shipper.  I'm extremely happy with this purchase.  Be extremely careful if you ever need to remove the plastic light shield to change the light bulb as the plastic housing is flimsy and can break easily (this may have happened to the other reviewers).  You need to line up two marks on the light housing to remove the shield without breaking it.  The instructions aren't very good about explaining this, but if you study the light housing in A LOT of detail, you will see the marks.Get the 17202, not the 17205.  The 17205, while it is less expensive, doesn't have the oil/water tray, the dressing tool, and the angle adjustable tool rests (this angle adjustment feature alone makes the 17202 worth the price difference).  From the picture of the 17205, it doesn't appear to have the thumb screws on the adjustable tool rest, and it doesn't appear that the tool rest is made from an aluminum billet like the 17202 (looks like stamped metal instead).Also, looking at the grinder from the side shows the 8 grinding wheel (when it is new) clearing the motor housing by about 1 inch.  Just wanted to include this information in case anyone is concerned about clearance.I'm writing this review because I wish I read something like this from other reviewers so I wouldn't have been apprehensive about this purchase.  Don't worry, about the few negative reviews - you won't be disappointed in this bench grinder.  It's GREAT! 	muellerp	10-21-2015 02:15:17	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes	Performance defect because of issues when removing the plastic light shield for the light bulb	false
60739176	I have had this tool for about 4 years. It has worked out well for sanding, cutting out grout and square cutting wood. But don't get fooled by what you see on TV. Cutting wood goes very slow (or the blade will overheat and dull really fast). As far as cutting a nail you can probably cut one but trying to cut more is a no-go since the blade wares out with the first cut. I did have one blade simply fall apart at the spot welds though. 	muellerp	10-21-2015 02:15:17	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes	Performance defect because the product does not perform to what is advertised	false

38112303	As the owner of a stone house, I need to have a drill like this just to hang stuff on my walls. And it does the job. From satellite dishes to picture frames (outside and in) it can drill through the toughest rock -- and better than the competitors tools. The hammer function works great and the batteries have a good long use time when fully charged. I've also used it for drywall and cabinet installations. And I use it most heavily for maintainance on stalls, doors, and other hardware on my barn and feneces. 	winp0007	10-22-2015 12:30:06	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

46402917	Works like a charm on smaller pieces of wood, etc.. approximately 2 inches high or lower.  Cross cutting not big enough for 2X4 but works for straight cuts.  Laser is slightly inaccurate and it is very difficult to set angles.  I had to paint the angle numbers in silver color to able to read from a distance.  Has a strong motor that is very smooth.  It is very portable and includes a nice carry handle.  All in all good for casual homeowner for cutting small trim or other small stock.

57491358	Have used it steady for three months now and love it. I saw some other reviews about the speed of the drill being unmanageable. I found that after a few hours of work it becomes second nature. If you don't use it often enough to get a feel for it try getting a guide to help with drilling holes. There are some decent ones for about $20. As for screws, well you just have to figure it out.

Well balance for easy carrying.

44108984	This is a solid benchtop drill: heavy construction of stand and drill table, stable and plenty accurate for my purposes.  Easy to assemble - all the parts were there and the instructions clear.  I mainly use for woodworking, so can't comment on utility for more precise machining in metal.Laser doesn't work on mine - and if it were a more expensive tool I suppose I might have returned it or asked for a replacement laser, but I wasn't really planning on using it, so am still satisfied. 	winp0007	10-22-2015 12:37:46	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

38312204	I do a fair amount of pinball machine repair and this waxer was recommended by one of the top restoration pros in the community.  Needless to say, I was eager to check it out.  For this review, I tested it on my car, since the color and surface was more consistent than a typical pinball playfield.The actual base is 6, but it is a random orbit polisher, so you're looking at 7-8 of actual coverage when the unit is powered on.  The front edge stays fairly close to the front edge of the actual unit, but the back end comes out beyond the actual polisher an inch or so.  You would think that this unbalanced pattern would make the waxer harder to control, but that's not the case.The actual waxer is a bit larger than I expected.  You can see in the item photograph that the height is a bit greater than the width, so it's probably about 7 tall.  I was expecting a lower profile.  The packaging emphasizes the light-weight design, and the unit does feel very light, but not cheap or flimsy.  The build is solid, the switch mechanism has a solid feel, and the bonnets are actually much better quality than I expected.  They probably won't last forever, but should hold up in the washing machine.  I would recommend tossing them in a the dryer before use, or you're going to face a lot of little fuzz spots from the provided bonnets.  Not a big deal, and typical.Overall, I am very pleased with the WEN 6010.  I could see getting around the car in an hour if you really take your time, less given the coverage.  You can operate it one-handed with no issues, so its not like a 10 waxer that demands both hands ALL THE TIME.  This way you can change hands when you get worn out.  It is very light, but I would have liked a bit of a rubbery grip to be added, just for stability.  As is, its just smooth, hard plastic casing.  The cord is 6' long, and I would have liked it to be a big longer, but odds are you'll be bringing an extension cord out either way. 	winp0007	10-22-2015 12:38:40	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

47604642	I was surprised/disappointed to learn that the sander is an oscillating sander rather than a random orbital sander.  I had thought about taking the plunge for a Fein RAS (expensive) and thought that this was a great opportunity to get one along with the other gadgets.  I was wrong.  The pad must be completely on the work piece of the disc will dislodge and actually cause damage to the pad.

(It isn't that bad) I have since purchased a DeWalt hammer drill that uses the same XRP battery pack and will be adding more tools from the DeWalt XRP line. Very pleased. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:08:51	No Defect		Novice	No		false
1107849	This is a pretty good product to have handy in a drawer for little quick jobs that don't justify getting out the trusty (but large) 18volt driller/driver.  It's a good size, easy to learn to use and designed fairly well.  This is prefect for installing a few long winded bolts like the kind you#8217;d find on a vacuum cleaner body, washmachine, ect.  Also this works fine for drywall screws, removing cabinet screw and such.  The motor is NOT powerful enough sinking wood screws or anything of that nature.Pros:Good sizeEasy to useWell designedThe only 3 things I don't really like about it (and these are minor complaints):1- It's kind of weak, don't expect to sink a 2#34; wood screw with this.  I'm sure it's not designed for this but it is a little weaker than I expected.2- The battery life isn't that great.  I would have expected a lot longer life from a single charge than it seems to get but I just keep the charger handy on my work station.3- It#8217;s pretty much impossible to #8220;start#8221; the driver in #8220;neutral#8221;.  By this I mean, once you push the palm button the bit will start turning (forward or reverse) regardless of how straight you try to hold the driver, I would like it better if the bit didn#8217;t move at all until you intentionally started twisting your wrist.  Again, though, these are small things, for the price it#8217;s a good product to have handy in a drawer. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:08:51	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
32192280	Smooth running machine w/ tight fit and feel.  Quality components.  Dust collection needs improving.  No option given for dust bag.  Cast miter scale gets covered w/ sawdust as does magnified pointer (Keep an air nozzle handy!)  I ended up using a Sharpie to make some of the angles more visible. Dust gets into bevel lock down causing saw head to slide down to 45' bevel, even during a cut. Customizable miter stop feature allows for one stop only...not very helpful when doing crown, base or other cuts where you need a corresponding angle.  Fence extensions do not slide far enough out of the way and must be disassembled to reach certain compound angles.  Miter lock handle quickly became loose and fell off.  Trigger safety button would be nice.  Quality laser would be nice.  I've owned this saw for about a year and still can't get used to it.  I find myself going back to my nine-year-old Makita LS 1211.  I would not buy this saw again. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:08:51	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

49968169	I've always wanted a Dewalt drill and now that I have one I'm glad I bought it. I've owned MANY cordless drills from Craftsman to Black and Decker and most in between. The secret is in the battery. This drill comes with two. I've fallen for the cheapo Harbor Freight $20 drills but they last about a year. The drill doesn't die but the battery does. It simply doesn't hold a charge. I can shelf my Dewalt for 6 months and it holds a charge like new. Not that you'd want to but the battery quality makes ANY cordless tool. Well balanced and just feels right. To me well worth the $$. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:12:11	No Defect		Expert	No		false
55288498	My husband surprised me with this sander for my birthday.  I love crafting, and my biggest time consumer has been the hours of sanding.  With this, I'm now spending only minutes on sanding.

It will not take off lugnuts that have more than 150 ftlb of torque applied, so I can only use it on vehicles that have had there wheel lugs truly torqued and just hammered down will a air impact (Which is most vehicles)..

26236097	I have two of these 890 series routers and wish I had more.  I started off with just a fixed base thinking I didn't need the plunge base and didn't have the money for it at the time.  Now I have this kit and the other with just the fixed base.  As for what I think of this kit, I'll take the managers' approach to this review (good, bad, good).For starters, the wrench for table top adjustment - AMAZING.  Even if you have another 890 series router, go spend the $30 on this tool.  It seems rather expensive at the time, but in the end will save you a lot of time, anguish, and skin on your knuckles.However, when this unit sits in the router table, as mentioned in other reviews, wood chips and sawdust get lodged inbetween the base and the motor, making it VERY difficult to remove to make the removal of the base from the table easier.  This is no longer an issue for me though since one of my routers is essentially a permanent fixture in my router table while I use this kit for any out of table routing I might have.Overall, the action is very smooth.  I have not had an issue with the plunge base as others have reported, however the plastic piece w/ the red line for the depth guage has been broken since day one and I have not had a chance to make it to the Porter Cable store to attend to the matter.I would definitely recommend this kit.  Remember - if you think you don't need the plunge base now, once you get better and more crafty with your router, you'll be kicking yourself for not getting both, because it's foolish to buy the plunge base after the fact because you end up spending more than necessary. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:14:13	No Defect		Expert	No		false
39468018	I have used many other types that all fell apart. They all had the same design flaw with multiple parts screwed together with couplers. They all come loose and then gears strip out in a short period time. Then I got a Ampro 15 years ago. After using it every day all them years it's still going strong. Recently had the same problem at my other shop across town. One of my mechanics got a Craftmans and it fell apart in an hours time of use. Sears would not help BTW.

It's very handy and light and will loosen most bolts and hex fasteners but lacks the torque I was hoping for.  Regardless it has become a very useful tool and speeds the assembly  disassembly for most of the applications I expect to use it for.  Plusses are its small size and light weight.  The extra battery is good also.  As a week-end warrior with a semi professional shop I would recommend this tool, however for every day use, you may want to seek out a more powerful product.Also, it's made in Mexico, which is not great but a hell of a lot better than the Chinese crap that's all over the market.  I figure if we employ them over there they might stop jumping the fence over here. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:14:13	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes	Performance defect because it lacks torque expected by customer.	false
30838899	I got this, not knowing if it would be as good as the Fien model, that is twice the price, but it works really well.  I haven't had the chance to use all of the attachments, but the ones I have used work great.  Especially the sanding attachment.  I look forward to many years of use from this tool. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:18:52	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
43156647	I excitedly received the combination belt/disc sander with the closed stand.  A great upgrade and addition to my shop.The belt sander works as expected but the disc sander has up to 1/4 inch of lateral run out.  The disc wobbles worse than a bike wheel with a couple of spokes missing.I looked to see if the shaft / keyway / disc mating surface was misaligned - Nope.No adjustment possible so I chalk this one up to poor quality control on the disc run out.Amazon was great.  I called and told them the issue and they promptly sent out another one without even having to return the first one.  I was impressed.  I was also notified that if I didn't return the first one (with disc run out) my credit card would be charged for the second unit, which is only fair.I received the second unit in 2 days.  I opened the box to only find the same issue, just as bad.I contacted Amazon again and they advised to keep both units until they can do an investigation.  The investigation should take about a week.The options at that time will be either to return both units, shipping is paid for and UPS pick up from our home and Amazon issues a full refund, or they ship a new unit that has been verified to run true and ship back the two defective units.This is where I am at.  Stay tuned.Amazon also gave me the Jet Tool number to call and discuss the issue with them and see if they can rectify the issue.Follow up is supposed to be in a week.  I will post another review after this.Amazon has been great, but you can't cover up poor quality or a missed critical inspection station.I expected more from Jet as all the other Jet tools in my shop work fine. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:18:52	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
59178432	This filtration system greatly reduces the dust in my shop (and my lungs). Seems to be well made. Fairly noisy, but the noise is due to air movement rather than vibration so does not create noise outside my shop. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:18:52	No Defect		Expert	No		false
56236183	This is my first Jet regulator. Chose this over the IR as the gauge is replaceable unlike the IR. It is solidly built and quite big for me as I normally use 1/4#34; and 3/8#34; regulators. The bulk just lends to the feeling of solidity.No leaks, excellent threads. All reducers and connectors went in without issue.The metak cage on the drain bowl locks into place and cannot accidentally open.4 stars because you can't get to the part to tighten the gauge as it mounts very very close to the main body of the regulator. You have to hand tighten using the gauge body, but, fortunately this is sufficient and it does not leak. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:18:52	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
44213240	Arrived quicky, well packaged and in perfect conditon. I purchased this compressor to replace a senco pc1010 because I wanted a bigger air tank to reduce cycling and I liked the two large pistons on rollair to also reduce time to get back up to pressure. The senco is really a great compressor that weighs half as much as (19lbs) the rollair and is nearly as quiet.  if I have alot of trim nailing to do I grab the rollair, if I am installing cabinet trim with 18 or 23 gauge I take the senco because of the even smaller size and weight. All that being said, the rollair is a fabulous compressor with a very solid and durable frame that I am very glad that I purchased. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:18:52	No Defect		Expert	No		false
48515874	I got this machine about a year ago and it's worked flawlessly.  Plenty of power.  In fact, I've never had an instance when the drill couldn't do what I've asked of it.  It might be on the big and heavy side for those who are used to smaller cheapo cordless drills.  I've had a 14.4V unit as well and was happy, so I decided to try out the next power up.The fit and finish is fine.

37415795	I have some other Makita power tools and bought this sander because I am very happy with the other Makita products that I have, however this sander is just not as powerful as I would like.

24371711	I have had a DeWalt drill for some time. I really like the chuck design which makes placing a drill bit or screw driver bit easy and almost a one-handed operation. The stop when power is shut off is a nice touch as well. The rugged good looks and attractive design seem to be just right. This new drill is smaller in size but just as powerful as my last DeWalt drill.

45683108	I bought this one because I had a prvious Dewalt that I liked a lot and used for about 6 years before it finally died. This one looked similar but had the low profile and the pad brake.I've been using it for about a week now and it has performed to expectation. The dust removal is particularly good - I just hook my small shop vac to it directly and there is no dust.I saw others complain about the large handle, but I have small hands and had no problems using the sander for an hour or more at a time.All in all, a great purchase. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:23:25	No Defect		Expert	No		false

58387862	Great tool!  I've used mine for drilling in concrete and wood - and it works superbly for that - but this weekend I used it to chip out some old floor tile and thinset.  With a 1 1/2 inch chipping bit the old tile didn't stand a chance, and for taking out the thinset, it was particularly awsome.  Key words here are 1) Gets the job done, 2) One tough tool, and 3) Very little vibration.1) After a short learning curve, (Attack tile from the corners and where two tiles meet. Attack thinset at 90 degrees to the trowel grooves.) the tile and thinset basically flew off of there.2) Tough tool.  I ran the tool for about two hours straight before lunch and another two hours straight after lunch with only short breaks to clear debris.  It never even whimpered, and was going as strong at the end as when I started.  I noticed that it got a little warm, (So what did you expect?) and I kept checking it, but it never overheated.  The Bulldog lives up to its name for toughness.3)  Very little vibration.  Of course there is some.  It is a hammer-chipper after all.  However, for the record, the vibration is minimal - far less than my string trimmer, for example.  After four hours working this thing, my hands and arms were never numb.  I was impressed.  You can chip all day and not get beat up!  The Bulldog is also a comfortable dog.The ability to adjust the angle of the bit is a very positive feature.  You can adjust it to what ever angle that is most effective or comfortable.  The Bulldog is fairly light weight too.  It won't wear you out just carrying it around, but it still packs a wallop.As I mentioned, drilling with or without the hammer feature is awsome.  You can set if for drill only, drill and hammer, or hammer only.  This is one 5 star tool!Furthermore, the Bulldog is very moderately priced.  I learned long ago that cheap tools are no bargain - but good tools at a bargain price are!  This is a good tool, and it doesn't cost that much either.  By the way, I had another brand rotary hammer - about the same size - that comes dressed in yellow - sold it.  This Bosch is leagues ahead of that other one.Can it do everything - maybe not, but just about everything.  I do have one of those big elephant-like rotary hammers for the REALLY BIG jobs, but 9 times out of 10, I reach for the Bosch Bulldog - and it gets the job done.By the way - When using this tool or any other rotary hammer, wear safety glasses, a GOOD dust mask, ear muffs, and gloves.  Don't skimp on any of those!  I know there are some macho types out there that think that stuff is for wimps.  Well listen, Bubba - You ain't bullet proof.  The wimps will be out there making money while you are in the emergency room or getting fitted for hearing aids.  Put on the safety gear!  It's extremely important!Good tool - quality tool.  I like it. and I think you will too.06/2004 - Quick edit - I like this tool so much that when the opportunity came along to acquire a used one, I bought it and now have two.  Why?  Just because it is a great tool, and I can have one in the truck and a back-up at home.  JM 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:26:28	No Defect		Expert	No		false

72146548	I have a corded Milwaukee Sawzall, having gone through a Harobr Freight knock-off in short order. The positive experience witht he new saw led me to consider a Milwaukee cordless. I'm glad I did. I have heard for some time that they are the best on the market, and when I saw this system at about 300 bucks and shipping, I jumped on it. The 4 Ampere-hour batteries last so long that I don't take the charger with me for one-day jobs. The little screw-gun is now my main tool. I bought hex-shank drills, and use it for everything. The big drill comes out only for harder jobs, or ones requiring more versatility. I have Makita and black and Devker tools as well, and have great respect for Dewalt, but in my opinion, this Milwaukee system tops them all. I even use the impact driver (screw gun) for light automotive work, despite having a large compressor and pleny of air tools. The Milwaukee is light, and usually closer to hand. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:29:58	No Defect		Expert	No		false

33568598	This drill has a couple of weak points:  the reversing switch is sticky and awkward;  the paddle switch is very broad and sensitive (be sure to unplug when you are changing drill bits, lest your cord get tangled in the chuck);  the entire unit is a little too heavy. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:31:34	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
38561648	I have owned this saw since 1997 and it has been a daily use tool on my job sites.  It has cut through just about everything imaginable and has never been pampered. The power of this saw is top of the line as is the base plate. The saw was built to last and it has for me for almost 15 years. My only complaint with this saw is that it worked so well for so long that when the switch finally went on it in November 2011 I found that I'm having trouble finding a replacement. I really hate to throw the saw away because it is the best saw I've ever used and I have grown quite fond of it's reliability. If anyone knows a place to get a new switch for the saw please leave a comment and let me know where, I would greatly appreciate it. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:31:34	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

Works with all of DeWalt's18v tools, these new batteries fit older 18v DeWalt tools, and the old 18v Ni-Cads fit these newer tools.

36198359	I usually agree with Tim Allen's more power philosophy and had to think a while before choosing an 8-1/2 saw over the 10 models. I am happy with my decision.The primary reason for buying bigger chop saws is to cut wider boards. A 12 chop saw cuts a wider board than a 10. However, that reasoning doesn't apply to a sliding saw - a 10 cuts about the same width board as the 8-1/2. Another reason for a bigger saw is power and I was skeptical about the 8-1/2 when I set it up. However, I cut primarily hardwoods and have found the 8-1/2 adequately powered. As other reviewers point out, the 8-1/2 only bevel cuts to the left. That is a definite negative, but you can usually rotate the board and compensate. To me, getting the lighter weight without giving up board size and cutting power (small saw with big saw attitude) tipped the scale toward the 8-1/2. The shorter fence bothered me at first - I was accustomed to taller fences - but I have not found it to be a problem and I am VERY fussy on cut accuracy.Some advice to Hitachi: This is a great portable saw and you can make it nearly perfect if you modify the design to bevel both directions and make the stops a bit easier to click into. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:36:04	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
82347199	I wanted a powerful multi-tool because my first one from Sears, a rechargeable, with wrench for blade changes,  was a weakling and would stall and battery would wear out in no time. And blade changes were a hassle . .  you could never get it tight enough, and the hex receptacle got stripped. Sears put that one out before it was fully baked. In fact, it's off the market now.So, I went for this Rockwell multi-tool with electric cord and 3.0 AMPS.  . . . .HOLY MACKERAL this thing sizzles, cuts moldings and creates clearances etc. Worth every penny in the time it saves me!  I don't have to worry about a low battery. And the quick release/locking system works great...after I figured out all the ins and outs of how that locking handle worked.  It has a good case, and long enough power cord. Rockwell did their homework. Really!  Plus this tool can take many other makes of blades, so you never get stuck. Changing the non-Rockwell tools takes an extra step, but at least it can do it, and you never worry about having to find a certain make of blade.It's heavier than my first mult-tool, but not problem, that's what you get with more power. It's well balanced. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:36:04	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

The kit also comes with a bag to hold all three guns, very nice. I plugged it in, run up to 150 psi no problem. All components looked brand new. My only complaint was having to replace the air connection on the tank, $2.99 at Lowes and I was back in business. It have laid about 500 sqft of Hardwood floors and lots of window and door trim. The guns work perfectly. No missfires, no jams, exactly as expected.

22915919	Just another favorable review of one of my favorite power tools...The  weight is right, the handle angle is right, plenty of power, and it works  every time.  I bought this saw to replace a cheap DIY-special Black and  Decker and the difference was a revelation (of course, any  professional-quality tool would have been a revelation).The saw has  lived in indignity under my side bench for years, getting hauled out for a  variety of tasks.  I am a woodworker hobbyist and amateur household  carpenter.  I use this saw for the occasional garden shed, rough-cutting  sheet goods,  and to make sets and furniture for theatrical productions (I  married an actress).  In my light-duty work the saw is a marvel.I cannot  speak to its suitability for a professional framer, but it works great for  me.As a side note, I kind of lust after the left-bladed Porter-Cable,  but I worry about safety.  Is a left-handed blade more dangerous for a  right-handed woodworker?  You can see the blade more easily, which sounds  good to me, but it would put the blade much closer to my left hand (i.e.,  my movable clamp).

47068265	1.  My most used cordless tool.  I have a huge Ryobi 18V 3 speed hammer drill, thought I did not need this much smaller and lighter impact driver.  Was I ever wrong!  This is far better for driving screws than a drill motor, much faster on smaller screws, can drive up to 4 screws into naughty pine, though it slows down to a crawl.  Better for drilling small holes too, with the bits that have the hex driver end.2.  Far better and safer on the top of a tall ladder, as average torque is low, will not threaten to throw you off ladder or twist out of the hand like the big drill motor will do.  The impact action makes it easier to hold the Phillips bit to the screw.3. Ryobi did the right thing and introduced the 18V LiIon battery that was generally backwards compatible with the 18V nickel metal hydride, what other company supported their customers so?4. What do these cost as of June 2010, 60$?  Buy 4 of these for the price of the Makita.5. Longevity compared to Makita?  Unknown to me.  3 years of every weekend use, 2 day a week usage, and the brushes are just now starting to fail.6. 2013-07: I thought that the brushes were beginning to fail, because a few times the motor did not start upon trigger pull, had to wack it, but this just keeps going and going.  Built a balcony, deck, fences, over-loading it with 4 screws, and it just keeps going strong.  Nice. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:42:59	No Defect		Expert	No		false

46870802	a lot of torque, continuous variable speed trigger, sound and light, can't ask for anything else.understand that this is an impact wrench, it will start impacting upon resistance, this is not a precision driver, and will use brute force to drive!  haven't done much drilling with this except installing some catches for cabinets which worked just fine.  milwaukee is good stuff. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:49:39	No Defect		Expert	No		false
57533589	I thought it was very odd this has no drill bits so do not expect any when you receive it.  I am a woman and only do simple home tasks so I just needed something small but sturdy and this fits the bill perfectly.  Luckily, I still had the drill bits and screwdriver bits from my previous BD; drill and they worked just fine.  If you are a contractor or work on heavy duty projects this would not be the drill for you.  It is not powerful enough and if you are a constant user it would probably break fairly quickly.Just updating my review.  When I purchased this drill I just did so on the off chance I needed to drill a hole to hang up shelves through drywall or something like that.  However, I am now using it a lot to make concrete paver molds that require me to drill holes through 2x2 plus the particle board and it gets really slow by the time it hits the particle board and then after about 10 holes it just won't go anymore and I have to wait for a while for it to recharge.  This is very annoying.  I am using a 3/8 drill bit.  Now I can honestly back up my opinion I wrote before that if you really don't ever use a drill for anything but maybe drilling once in a great while and only light things then you should purchase this drill because it is a good deal for that.  But if you plan on doing anything heavier, and I don't consider what I'm doing heavy, you should go for a more powerful drill. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:49:39	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
23743233	My wife bought this tool on clearance, w/o packaging or instructions for $14.  We couldn't install blades.  Thanks to the guy who offered the Plier Trick.  To quote my wife, That guy saved you.To expand on his instructions:  If you can push the black button that moves the locking pin in and out, you need to do the trick.  Get needle nose pliers or a flat head screwdriver.  Push the black button, which extends the locking pin.  Insert a screwdriver or pliers through the hole on the opposite side and turn the end of that pin 90 degrees.  At this point, it should not retract completely when you release the button.  Now, place the blade over the pin and rotate 90 degrees into place.  The pin should retract.  To remove the blade, push the black button, rotate the blade out of operating position (90 degrees) and slide it off the pin.  It is now in position to install the next blade.Hope this is useful! 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:49:39	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
29397780	This is a great small angle grinder. It has plenty of power and the three  position handle is an advantage in certain situations over two position models.  The only reason I give it 3 stars instead of 5 is the safety switch.  It is a pain to operate out of the box.  I had to file it down to use it, now it works fine.  Milwaukee has a similar switch on their small angle grinders that is just as effective and works much smoother.  I would not buy this grinder again because off the switch.  A safety switch should be an aid to the user, not a hindrance. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:49:39	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
40841379	I like this drill for many very good reasons, but it is also very frustrating for a lot of good reasons.It has really good torque, I have rarely had to grab my corded drill because I needed more power.-But the brushes still give off an ozone odor a year after I bought it and I've remodeled a kitchen with it so it's hard to believe they aren't seated yet.The batteries charge really fast.-But after a little more than a year they started failing.  After a year and a half one is completely shot, the second is almost worthless.It has a lifetime warranty-But the nearest service center is over an hour from my house, and if I ship it they will only pay for return shipping.  I also have to ship the entire kit (batteries, charger, and drill) even if the only concern I want addressed is the batteries.Would I buy it again?  I don't know.  I'm going to give it another shot, get the batteries replaced and see how it goes.  If I find myself in the same position in another year and a half then I'll probably e-bay it and buy something with a less impressive warranty. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:53:54	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

27592074	Black  Decker makes many power tools for the occasional handyman. I like the features of this jigsaw, sightline, dust blower, blade storage.

55118176	I have been involved in a lot of carpentry over the years and have used many nailers and own several (framing, finish, roofing) but this is my first experience with laying hardwood flooring and floor nailers so I didn't have a good point comparison when making a choice.  Finally I purchsed the tool after doing a lot of research even though I was a little concerned about quality in an inexpensive nailer.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  The nailer was used to install about 600 sq./ft of hickory flooring and it worked far better than my expectations.  Not one jam and no misfires except the one time I didn't hit hard enough with the hammer.  There were no problems with air hose connections or seals leaking.  The nailer was relatively easy to use -- just took a little getting used to.  There was no marring of the wood surface (prefinished).  I am sure there are much better quality nailers but considering I was using it on just one application it was a real bargain (would have cost as much or more to rent a nailer).  Very satisfied with the nailer. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:56:02	No Defect		Novice	No		false

35353311	Background:  After having my 14.4 volt Black and Decker Firestorm Combo Set stolen, I spent weeks doing research on new and reconditioned tools. I found my old Combo Set very useful and intended to replace it with a similar set up: drill, circular saw, light, reciprocating saw charger and two batteries (with an additional drill and two more batteries to be purchased later).  I made multiple trips each to Home Depot, Lowes, and Sears to check sales as well as try the feel of various brands.  I also spent many hours online reading reviews and price checking.  In my store visits I encountered several sets that would have made good purchases, including a Porter Cable Combo Set on sale at Lowes.My priorities:  I would have gladly gone with Black and Decker and 14.4 volt technology again.  Those tools were a good investment, and, at about $130, the best CHEAP deal I could find.  In thousands of hours and six years of heavy home use, the B  D set rarely lacked power.  Four batteries and two drills were adequate for continuous use in drilling holes and driving screws.  Perhaps even more importantly, I got very lucky with the balance, weight and grip of those tools (especially the drills).  They fit my hands comfortably, enabling me many hours of use with minimal fatigue.  I enjoyed using those tools.  Comfort, usefulness and durability became my top priorities in replacement. Price was important, but secondary.Results:  It came down to Makita and Milwaukee.  Their overall reputation for reliability and customer satisfaction is very good.  The drills seem balanced and fit my hands well.  I opted for the 18 volt Lithium batteries, which do not seem as heavy as similar NiCad batteries and will probably be manufactured for many years.  However, there seemed to be occasional mechanical issues with Makita tools and batteries.  Additionally, when shopping, I seemed to be able to find more complete and less expensive Combo Sets from Milwaukee.  In part this was due to the excellent prices and selection at CPO Milwaukee.  I ordered the Combo Set about six months ago.  It arrived promptly and in excellent condition (there was minimal packaging and some damage to the box but the contents were unaffected).  The tools appear new or very close to new. I have used all the tools to some degree.  They feel very solid and all work perfectly.  I can feel a large improvement in each individual tools quality over my old set, although they are a little heavier.  The saws both feel much sturdier and stronger, and I plan to use the cordless circular saw as a replacement for my (also stolen) corded circular saw. There are nice features on the tools:  built in work lights, a good chuck on the drill, the head of the light swivels, a great carrying bag, the circular saw has an easily adjustable shoe and, an amazing improvement in ease of use, the blade is mounted on the left side of the saw.  Also, one of the included batteries was the lighter, more compact 18 volt XC.Notes and quibbles:  Quibbles - the Milwaukee batteries are sometimes a little difficult to insert into and remove from the tools or charger.  Notes - I replaced my second stolen B D; drill with a very compact Bosch 12 volt impact driver from CPO Bosch.  I will eventually write a second review.  In summary:  I love it. I will probably purchase the matching drill. The impact driver, which has plenty of power and fits and feels great in my hand, can be carried in a large pocket.  It's only drawback, in impact mode, where it operates much of the time, is LOUD!  I have taken to using earplugs.I would gladly purchase these tools again and CPO did its' part perfectly.Second update, Dec 2012 (In the comments, I have done an update concerning a repair done in 2011):I use the drill frequently and still find it exceptional.The batteries continue to be difficult to insert and remove from the tools.The light stands well on its own base and the vertical swivel is very useful. On the whole, it feels well designed except for the on/off switch. It has always been incredibly stiff and difficult to push. This feels like a design flaw, not a problem with this tool in particular.The reciprocating saw is very useful and good enough for almost all my purposes, but if I had a frequent need for this kind of saw, or even if I had one project which put it to extended heavy use, I would probably buy a corded one.The same is true for the circular saw. Although I love its design (ease of use, portability, light weight),it does not have quite enough power or a deep enough cut for heavy jobs. I have purchased a corded circular saw for heavy work, but still frequently use the Milwaukee cordless.All in all - I am still very happy with this purchase. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 18:56:02	No Defect		Novice	No		false

Don't you hate having to wait around for a big, strong someone - with just the right tool - to do a bit of simple screwing so you can have a dreamed of bookshelf or day bed assembled, or have an amazing bit of intricate grill work hung on a bare wall, or a tubular bird feeder screwed to the deck or fence?One could easily use a manual screwdriver, but that is soooo last century, tedious, strains the wrist and does not create that Wow effect, i.e. neighbor envy when used outside. :)  Ah, if only you had a streamlined tool that wasn't too heavy, yet had plenty of stamina for lots of impromptu projects!DEWALT DCF815S2 12-Volt Max 1/4-Inch Impact Driver Kit is Perfect for smaller hands.  Why should the guys have all the cool tools?  Modern, sleek, light weight with lots and lots of energy -- and does not tire the hand, like a larger unit would.  Can be used throughout the house and around the outside for numerous projects us ladies sometimes wait-and-wait-and-wait for a guy to get around to doing. 'nuf said!This 12Volt lithium Ion battery kit takes  inch hex accessories and 1 inch bit tips, includes a charger and 2-battery packs, has forward/reverse control, 3-LED work lights, and quick release chuck and a very handy carrying bag.I initially used this tool to unscrew several bar stools for storage. It's compact size made it easy for me to maneuver between the stool chair pegs to unscrew the seats from the stools. This tool is lightweight, and powerful. Its chuck release is easy and efficient. This is great tool for a multitude of applications.DEWALT DCF815S2 12-Volt Max 1/4-Inch Impact Driver Kit goes where you go -- just charge the long lasting battery pack and begin to get all those projects you've been putting off done.A Pleasure to use, instant results!

31852525	This grinder has turned out to be the most handy and useful tools I've purchased in this line of Makita tools.  I find myself reaching for this tool more than I ever did my corded version, simply because it's so capable and nimble since there's no cord to deal with.  Most of my use is for sharpening lawnmower blades, deburring metal or grinding down welds and it works great.  I  sharpened 5 mower blades (pretty heavy ginding) on one battery.  Granted, this tool drains batteries the quickest of all the LTX tools I have, but I expected as much from a tool doing this kind of labor.  If I had to come up with a down side to this tool.....I guess havening a trigger instead of a slide switch would be nice, and maybe having it with variable speed would be nice too incase I wanted to sand of buff with it, but I'm not complaining at all.  If you're teater-tottering over whether to get one of these or not,  get it,  You'll be glad you did. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 19:00:20	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes	Performance defect because of batteries draining	false

25909097	I previously owned the 12v Hitachi impact driver from about four years ago and it was a great little tool. (still is) When the batteries were in better condition I could assemble cabinets all day and sink the occasional handful of #8 3 screws when needed for installs.I picked up this micro 12v? (it feels like 10)combo and thought it could at least handle  1-1/4 pocket screws in white oak face frames. It does, but the speed is greatly reduced and I could feel the little motor screaming under load. 1-1/2 screws in 3/4 ply was surprisingly slower as well. My old 12v Hitachi would handle these simple tasks with ease.This drill driver combo is an excellent little kit for light duty tasks such as cabinet hinge installation and drawer glides if that's all you needed it for everyday.My current go-to set is the 18v Bosch drill-driver and impact gun, these new guns are so light they feel like the old 9v of long ago. I thought I'd give these little Hitachis a shot since I couldn't pass up the price ($137.00)but they got returned to the store.I won't downgrade their usefullness for lighter applications, they simply didn't suit mine. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 23:24:33	No Defect		Expert	No		false

34393464	Milwaukee is the way to go in my opinion. This drill has an electric clutch that works great. You can get this into places you never thought you could drill.

37193234	So far i've disposed of a two old trees ,  using the the hitachi it had more then enough power to get the job done easily.The only PLUS MINUS i could find was with the trigger - it was so light to the pull - causing me some concern about how easy it would be to accidently start up when not intending to cut anything. Which happened several times when i was trying to reposition and then hang the tool from its grip. But when actually cutting the easy trigger was a plus.Just be extra cautious is what i'm saying about the trigger . Overall  a great deal ! 	muellerp	10-22-2015 23:33:15	Safety Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
46402917	Works like a charm on smaller pieces of wood, etc.. approximately 2 inches high or lower.  Cross cutting not big enough for 2X4 but works for straight cuts.  Laser is slightly inaccurate and it is very difficult to set angles.  I had to paint the angle numbers in silver color to able to read from a distance.  Has a strong motor that is very smooth.  It is very portable and includes a nice carry handle.  All in all good for casual homeowner for cutting small trim or other small stock.  Highly recommend for above purposes. 	muellerp	10-22-2015 23:33:15	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

48775856	This was ordered to use with my quarter sheet sander.  I haven't found much use for the old machine nor my belt sander since getting this sander.  With the quick change paper, I can shape with the 80 grit, and finish with the finer grits in seconds.  I think this is second only to my table saw in my shop.

42828920	As a home handyman, I didn't want to invest in a compressor.  They are nice, but I just work on my two cars, nothing professionally.  But was tired of having to break loose lug nuts before lifting the car off the ground.  Much to my surprise, this has more power than I thought it would.  I did my front struts and the nuts were rated at 182ft pounds.  It had no problem with them.  My axle nut is 140ft pounds and it has no problem with it.  Haven't found anything so far that this and PB Blaster won't take off.  There is nothing on either car that is even 250ft. pounds, so I am happy, with it.  Between this, a dremel and hand tools, I can get by OK. My impact sockets come off this easily but somehow my craftsman extension is hard to get off.  I found I really don't need an extension, end of problem. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 00:43:19	No Defect		Novice	No		false

Though it does take some time to cover a large surface.Drawbacks -- the cord is kind of short -- but that's easily remedied with an extension cord, and you probably wouldn't want a super long cord on such a small appliance.  My other gripe-- the little polishing bonnets were pretty hard to get on and off.

33623235	To save reading/typing, I'll echo what M/M Larsen, Martin, and Takahashi all said. I bought mine for the exact reason of M. Larsen....Additionally, I was in the water intrusion forensics in the mid-90s and saw someone use it on stucco to line out where to break out the stucco. They had multiple batteries and back then, the saw was a wonder.People have to remember that in the early-mid-90s, 9.6v was state of the art. The saw seems so under powered now, but back then, it was one of the first of its kind. Makita does make a 14.4v unit.Longevity: I used mine on site over several years and 40 water intrusion forensic jobs...inside and outside (mostly for drywall, though), and I have the original one I bought in 1996. I bought a little tool box for it and have been soooooo happy.I retro-fitted the masonry water-drip kit and have cut tile, flagstone, brick, maybe thin concrete, and most recently....a granite countertop--all counter to opinion I heard today from a Home Depot whiz. Where other saws don't fit, this one does (heads in, not the long tail-end) with much less chance of overcutting--kind of important on one-time-get-it-right cuts.It isn't good for plunge cutting (not a surprise---other saws are designed for that), and the batteries don't last long if you're doing heavy cutting. But for small, fine cuts...Foot stomp: like the others said... get a carbide blade. Oh, charge the battery before using it out of the box. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 01:00:28	No Defect		Expert	No		false

It's made quick work of a number of jobs, and the tools feel very good - solid and nicely made.One of the batteries I received had a broken clip, but this was pretty smoothly sorted out by the vendor. The units have 'Reconditioned' stickers on the handle that can't be easily removed (you can remove the sticker, but it leaves behind a mark).

54964077	From reading the good reviews this tool received, I thought the warnings of blade removal/insertion problems were probably from user lack of reading instructions or brute force.  I am a woman with over 20 years experience with power tools, I read and follow instructions carefully, and I do not force things to their breaking point.  However, after one use with this tool, instructions in hand (having been forewarned), I went to change the blade.  Though I followed instructions to the letter, I couldn't get the blade out.  Again and again I tried, not knowing what I was doing wrong.  The top plastic piece then broke right off leaving me in the middle of a job with no tool to finish.  This tool looks brand new; I had purchased it, used it once, then didn't need it again until after the store would take it back.  They really messed up on this one.  It doesn't matter how good it runs if you can't get a blade in and out. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 01:38:12	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false

47242503	I have owned an 8 dual bevel Hitachi miter saw for many years and it has worked very well.  It was pricey because of the dual bevel feature which I knew I wanted because of single bevel experience with my radial arm saw.  I purchased this saw because I was planning to add wide crown molding to my kitchen/family room.  There are 3 ways I know of to cut crown molding:  1) set the miter saw miter and bevel to the correct angles, 2) build a jig to support the molding, eliminating the need to set a bevel angle, 3) buy a jig instead of building one.  The problem with setting the saw to the correct angles is repeatability.  That is, there are miter detents but no bevel detents.  So, it is unlikely that you could repeatedly set the saw for multiple cuts.  If you look online you will find several homemade jigs that could be built.  But, this is more work than I wanted to do.  So, I purchased the Kreg Crown molding jig.  This jig, and other jigs, require a larger turntable than my 8 Hitachi had.  Furthermove, it's impossible to cut wide crown molding with an 8 saw.  So, just for this one crown molding project I went looking for a 12 saw.  See my review of the Kreg crown molding jig which I have discarded.  Since I'm an old geezer, I didn't want to pay more than I had to.  It was at this point that I became guilty of drinking and driving on the internet highway.  Because of my previous experience with my 8 Hitachi, I was instantly in love with this 12 saw.  It was dual bevel and it was cheap.  I did download the manual and thumb through it.  There was confusion here as the manual covered both this model and the digital readout version.  So, I think I assumed that I was getting the digital readout version (which may have solved the repeatability problem when setting both the miter and bevel angles to cut crown molding).  This is the non-digital readout version and I decided to keep it anyway since it was my mistake and since the box it came in barely got it to me. I checked the table for accuracy and had to reset the fences for better accuracy.  Then, I decided to replace the blade.  The one that comes with it is okay.  You know for the price that they're not going to give you too good of a blade.  I prefer to use Freud blades but the 12 version of the blade I use in my 8 Hitachi was going to be about $125.  This blade literally polishes the workpience cutoff end, but, perhaps this level of smoothness is not often required.  So, I went to the local store that sells all kinds of cheap tools, some better than others, but cheaper offbrands.  You would know this place if I named it.  They had a 96 tooth, 12 blade for about $25.  I thought I'd try it and it works okay.  It's not the same as my Freud blade, but, it's okay.  Right away, I had trouble changing the blade.  There's a little metal cover that fits over the blade axle nut.  Probably some new, needless, government regulation.  To remove this cover, you have to remove two phillips head screws.  They were very tight, too tight for phillips head screws.  I got one out but the second one is partially hidden by the guard.  After stripping it, I drilled it out and threw the spindle cover and screws away.  As a minimum, they should have used allen head screws.  Next, I found that the supplied blade nut wrench won't fit on the nut because of interference with the guard (the SECOND guard problem) and had to use one of my metric end wrenches.  The fence is composed of three subfences, supposedly to provide more vertical support for a tall workpiece (a good thing).  But, subfence c. doesn't really attach firmly so I took it off and put it away.  Because I couldn't get fences a. and b. to perfectly line up with one another, I had to take fence b. off and enlarge the two mounting bolt holes for more adjustment range.  Lastly, and perhaps my biggest complaint, is that the motor has a tremendous startup torque.  You have to get used to holding on for dear life because it really bucks when you press the switch.  One could live with this unless you had a wrist problem.  The real issue for me is that the motor draws too much current when starting.  This is called inrush current and trips my garage ground fault circuit breaker at almost every startup.  So, instead of plugging this saw into an outlet near the saw, I have to plug it into a 50 foot extension cord connected to another type of ground fault breaker.  The cord provides series resistance which limits the inrush current.  The other breaker is slower to trip when excessive current is detected.  You can buy inrush limiting devices but they are not cheap.  Eventually, I will build my own (I am a retired electrical engineer).  If you buy a saw, make sure you buy slow-starting which would limit the startup torque and hopefully the inrush current.  As some have said, the laser guide is too weak to be used in sunlight.  The final insult was that about 3 months later, I saw this exact saw on sale for the exact price I paid for it at a local big box hardware store.  This usually means that a product is being discontinued and that they're being cleared out.  This saw is okay for the price but lacks the overall design quality that I expected based upon my experience with the 8 Hitachi.  I should have done my homework and maybe paid more. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 01:51:15	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

54414047	I purchased the Milwaukee from a local dealer in the later portion of April.  I was skeptical as to the durability of the product as a table router, but was soon impressed.  It lacks the power to keep a consistant rpm with larger bits (as a table router) but I am impressed with the performance for such a small router.  It realy shines in the ease of use.  From the hand held to the changing of bits to the adjustment of height.  It truly was thought out very well.  The only draw back is that It does not have a variable speed.  A must for someone that will perminately mount it under the table.  I also believe it would help to keep the rpm stable with larger bits.  If you are looking for a great small router or a first buy then this model will not dissapoint you.  However, I would suggest to just go down to a local Lowes or Sears.  It is priced at 164 and would be worth the lack of waiting for the shipping. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 01:55:06	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

22056798	I have to say, I'm quite impressed with this product. If you need a small drill/driver to get into small places or so you don't want to have to lug around a lot of bulky equipment, this is for you. It's actually quite powerful, but, since it doesn't have a clutch, that probably isn't the best thing for such a small drill/driver.  It could also use a locking hex socket for the larger bits, but it is magnetized; so, that seems to work well enough. There is only one speed and it would be great if it had a variable trigger, but I'm just nit-piking right now. In any case, it's a great product to have around to keep charging on the wall to grab for a little job here or there. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 01:55:06	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
39690481	These are nice tools. There very lite but that are VERY powerful. I drove 45 3 inch lags with the drill and still had plenty of battery life. I ripped through several board ft with the circular saw with plenty of power. I haven't use the reciprocating saw let. The light is a just a throw away in my opinion. The newer leds are far superior. For the price these are a great buy. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:01:05	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes	Peformance defect because poor light on the tool.	false

59727654	I don't think they make this model, anymore. Mine says made in Switzerland on it. It's been over 6 years, later, and this saw is great. The blade ejects and inserts, easily. It cuts beautifully, with almost no vibration.Bosch jigsaw blades are fantastic. With the right blade, this saw will crosscut maple and leave a shiny smooth finish that looks like it's been sanded an polished. Too bad it's so hard to cut a perfectly straight edge with a jigsaw.My saw tends to cut a bit off line. I know most jigsaws do. I wish there were a way to adjust the blade/shoe orientation on a jigsaw to allow for correction. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:04:31	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

33023332	I wish I had read the reviews but because I was ordering a Porter-Cable product I didn't think I had to. I just opened the box and can tell already that the quality has gone down dramaticly. The trigger is plasic and large enough to be well at home on a cartoon as well as seeming loose. The depth adjuster is the same. The quick release for the head is a good idea however the first time it gets dropped or stepped on, it will uncountably get bent. I have been in construction and have used porter-cabe for years. It was always a great product and has always lasted a long time, hence me being out of the market for a new one however if this gun is an example of the direction they are taking their company I'm afraid I will have to find a new brand. It is a shame to take such a hardy product and butcher it like this but that seems to be the norm these days 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:04:31	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
58276509	When i saw this product i was surprised because the kawasaki 12v impact wrench has the same design but different color. My kawasaki works great if you know how to use it. I think those people who made bad reviews for this product didn't know how to use this impact wrench and they got frustrated easily after several attempt of removing their lug nuts.

42815772	This compressor appears to match its specifications. It is the quietest I've heard in this class, although my unit does have an occasional squeal-- something rubbing --that is not much louder than the normal sound, but is a little more obnoxious. Also, like some other reviewers, I encountered loose bolts on the unit I received: the four bolts that secure the tanks to the frame needed tightening. Not difficult to tighten them, but it's odd to have so many loose screws running around! Overall, the workmanship and functionality seems very good. Many compressors of this size have wheels, and that would make handling easier. Pleased with the product to date. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:06:52	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

43340572	If there is a better designed and performing tool .... I don't own it just yet.  This tool performs impeccably, and my only regret is not having purchased it sooner.  However, I should add that I do take exceptional care of my tools, and clean/maintain them as needed.  I'm sure that if I did not maintain the tool as required, abused it, flung it into the back of a truck with no case, and used out of date fuel cells, I could probably replicate some of the complaints posted here.

27781502	First off, when the box was delivered it appeared to have been opened and reclosed more than once. The box was in bad shape and I am hopeful it can hold the item for one more trip back to Amazon!All the parts were there and as quickly as I unpacked the sander I repacked it. I believe you get what you pay for but I was hoping this would be an exception to the rule, however, it was not. The sander is cheaply made with plastic components for guards and the metal square sanding bracket (made of cash iron) is way off square. The bracket when tightened into place rubs on the sanding belt and if set in a position that will not rub on the sanding belt it will have no purpose. No amount of adjustment will make this sander work efficiently. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:20:40	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
46628943	I've had an earlier model of this same sander for several years. I decided the old one was getting past it's prime so decided buy a newer model. What a mistake! DeWalt changed the design of the slow start pad and as a result this new sander is about 10 times louder then the old one. It probably vibrates more too, but to tell you the truth I'm so distracted by the loud buzz that it's hard to tell.If I wanted a loud, high vibration sander I could have gotten one a lot cheaper! 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:20:40	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

56322260	This is my second M12V router.  I am impressed with the power of the motor, soft start, and wide range speed control for under $200.  My first router has been in service for over two years without any problems.  The only maintenance they receive is dusting off the excess saw dust and an occasional lubricant spray of the spring height adjustment mechanism.My routers are mounted on 3/4 medium density particle board and clamped to saw horses.  They make a breeze of raised panel doors, dados, and decorative trims.  For the professional or serious wood hobbyist the setup and change out time justifies having a dedicated M12V to the more commonly used router bits like the stile, rail and panel.I highly recommend the M12V - it's a winner! 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:20:40	No Defect		Expert	No		false
26599356	I have only used this once so far, worked fine.  This is my first drill where you do not need a chuck key to tighten / loosen bits.  Love the hand chuck feature.The unit feels solid and not too cheap.The only thing about this drill that I was just a little disappointed about so far is the drill speed, depending on what your are working on, sometimes you want to have a slow drill speed, when starting holes, driving screws, when working on precise type stuff. On most drills you have a variable speed depending on how hard you pull the trigger, like a throttle in a car.  But his drill has only one speed FAST, so if working on a surface you do not want scratched up, you just have to start with very light pressure so you do not roll the bit all over the place, also  the use of a center punch first is always helpful.The plug is a 2 prong if that means anything,  other than a drill from the 70's I have, all my drills have had a 3 prong power cord.Other than the fixed speed, I have not come across anything yet that I find negative.For the price I think it would be hard to do better on a new drill. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:20:40	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

25352989	Bought this tonight at Lowe's for $109. Tried to make a few simple cuts for my son's Pinewood Derby car. Even with the laser, built-in light and good lighting, it was really difficult to focus on the blade since it was vibrating so much.

51963181	I have used this on several house remodels. It has been very reliable and powerful. I use it on occasional basis and have shot about 7000 nails out of it (about 100 a day). I use grip rite nails. Like the full head nails. Sometimes follow up with hammer if pressure too low.(about 95 lbs...)And prefer the 3 1/4 inch.  One helper(novice) loaded nails in wrong and was able to shoot nail out thru the frame.(lower angle). Unjammed the gun and kept going strong. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:25:01	No Defect		Expert	No		false

36776365	I love having this tool in my garage. I use it whenever I have to cut something at an odd angle or don't have much room to get in close.

41566327	Have had the 9 piece set for about 4 weeks now and its so far met all my expectations. The only tool I haven't used yet is the cut-out tool but this will probably save the day on some project eventually.As a woman one thing I really like is the shape of the battery; it is easy to get your hand around to release it from the charger one-handed. My last Bosch battery was so wide I couldn't do that and it was very awkard.On the down side the hammer drill/driver is a bit heavy compared to the Bosch, not so heavy that I can't use it but heavy enough to make my thumb ache after a day screwing down siding! Its a great tool though. 3 speeds plus the hammer feature.The circular saw is awesome, lightweight and lightening fast, cuts through stuff like butter. Storage bags are very practical, much better than hard cases. Even the flashlight that I didn't think I'd use is great, powerful light and no more crapped out batteries.Battery life seems good though I haven't owned the set long enough to see any problems.All in all a great set for a great price. Once you've got it you'll wonder what you did without it. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:27:07	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
40542475	We got these for $25 off during the fathers day sale, and even though I have a few of the 18v variety I opted for these littler bruisers. I have tried the drill many times and it still on the first charge. It handles well, is compact, the light useful and aimed at the work area, but you will have to buy dedicated bits for this since it only has the 1/4 hex lock. Figure you will need to add at least $20- 30 for a starter set. We already had the dewalt impact set for our larger tools so we only needed the drill bits and went for a set on sale at lowes that had a mixture of screw bits and drill bits. Only caveat its easy to forget on the drill which setting is high speed for drilling and which one high torque for driving.Tried the impact driver once to drive a small bolt, it feels undersized and not sure it would be good for normal deck work but for light duty work like door installations its probably a good unit, and the light on the impact driver better than the light on the drill unit.In hindsite I could have just bought the two speed drill since that is what I use the most around the house, I'm afraid that on the job I will be taking my bigger impact drivers since I do a lot of decking and ramps and it takes a bit of torque to drive a bunch of 6 in 3/8 in lag screws into PT wood, and I would be afraid the 12 volt unit would stall in the attempt 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:27:07	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

43513930	I am very disappointed with this tool. It makes me waste time to use it on the first day. I spent over a minute to remove a lug nut while I did the same job in few seconds with the regular tire lug wrench belong with my car. If you have patience to change your tire and time to return then take it. God bless me! I can return it. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:29:08	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
33421815	I'll admit up front that I haven't touched the wine bottle opener bit - I got this purely to use as a screwdriver because I need a compact but powerful rechargeable screwdriver around the house. And the main point that was appealing to me with this unit is the fact that it's powered by a lithium ion battery. I know now, after having suffered with other battery types (nicad, I believe) that lithium ion is the way to go because, once charged, they hold a solid charge for a long time. And true to form, this little driver has been sitting around, doing light duty - a quick tighten here and there - and still has as much drive-force as the moment it came off the charger. And this is a good couple months after I got it. Sure, when the battery runs out of juice, it'll just go, as lithium ion batteries run and run and run and then it's just kaputt, but that's good. I'd rather that than a gradual decline where there's a small window of good power and the screwdriver becomes more and more useless over time. I'm sure anyone who's used rechargeable screwdrivers is nodding their head at memories of small projects where those last screws are put in by turning that whole screwgun's mostly powerless body with the motor groaning. The battery, for those looking for this info, takes 3-5 hours to charge, according to the manual. Mine had a charge when I got it, so it didn't need a full charge.It's laid out very intelligently, with the forward/backward switch placed right where your thumb or finger can reach it when you're holding it, and has a bright amber light aimed at your screw head. It's got a lot of torque for such a small driver, but it does have its limits. Don't expect to build a cabinet with this thing, is what I'm saying. I haven't done any major jobs with it, but it's strong enough for most home jobs, but you'll want the big tools for heavy work.It comes with the obvious wine bottle opener, a foil cutter, and a chromed-metal rubber bottle stopper in addition to the actual useful, you know, *tools* - a small selection of bits held in a rubbery container. They're all the standard 1/4 inch hex size (if I'm not mistaken) so any other heads you have that fit will also work in this driver provided they are short enough to fit in the barrel. But there's one small nit to pick, and that is that in all the little extras they pack in they couldn't manage to offer *some* kind of case to hold all of this stuff. What am I supposed to do with all of this? I take it out and it all wanders around drawers, eventually getting lost. I won't be too upset losing the wine bottle parts, but I won't be very happy to lose the driver bits - but luckily my other driver heads fit in here. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:29:08	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
39962424	I've had this blower running in my shop for over 2 years. It was used daily and for several hours on average. Granted, I didn't actually use it for shop dust, as I was only sucking out fumes from some laser cutters I had. It definitely did the job and ran with no problems.I eventually switched to another 650CFM blower I found on Amazon. The other one was just a stand alone blower that you can attach a bag to. I hooked up the exhaust end to blow it directly out of the building instead this time around and that blower was a little quieter than this one. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 02:29:08	No Defect		Expert	No		false

37332034	Milwaukee wrote the book on Sawzalls, and this new one continues the legend. I looked at all the models both here on Amazon and on the factory site. I will be using it for home projects so I didn't feel I need either maximum power or orbital action. I have used it on two different projects-pruning and beam cutting and I'm totally satisfied! I needed to flush cut the end of a 4x6 beam in a difficult spot. It cut through like butter, and at the end of the cut which ended at a projecting eave, I could feather the switch and just cut the beam without damaging the eave. I think the orbital action would not have made that possible-to much bouncing around. I've also used it for heavy pruning and with the ability to get the blade into tight places makes all the difference! It sure has all the power I'll ever need, and it's not quite as heavy as the 15amp model. If you don't need it for heavy demo or construction I think you'll be happy!

39544072	Let's get the cons out of the way first.This was the absolutely worst packaging for shipping job I have ever seen and I order almost everything I buy online.I'm amazed the compressor arrived unscathed, probably only because it is heavy.The only protection/cushioning they used was 4 vertical square tubes of cardboard at the corners of the box. This allows the compressor to tip and wobble inside the box.Pros.Good quality.The compressor is not too noisy, and it kept up with the nailer/stapler very well.All the accessories listed came with it.Countersinks brads.Nice carrying handle.1 year warranty.I like the adjustable exhaust,that is when I remember to turn it away from my face.Repaired and reinforced my reclining chair quickly with the staples.Rebuilt my shed (old plywood off new 1/2plywood on) in no time.Edit/update: I used this compressor with a coiled roofing nailer to redo my 13 square roof. The compressor supplied plenty of air to keep up with my nailing, but it was just my son and I doing the shingles. That's over 4,000 nails.I don't think it could keep up with 2 nailers at once though.I see someone asked about using a HVLP sprayer with this compressor,I used it for spraying stains and clear coats on my DIY tower and subwoofer speakers, it did fine, but these are not very large surfaces. You, of course couldn't paint a car with this compressor.It is rated at 3.4 CFM at 40 PSI and 2.1 CFM at 90 PSI 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:16:12	No Defect		Novice	No		false

22936479	I picked up this saw at a pawnshop for $99. Hadn't been too heavily used (it appeared to have the original Dewalt blade on it). I slapped a $17 Dewalt diamond blade on it and cut through 25 linear feet of 2cm granite with it in an afternoon. It's technically a framing saw, but it's powerful enough to work as a masonry saw.Pros: Lots of power. Better balanced (in my opinion) than most other worm-drive or sidewinder circular saws. Fairly water resistant (I was running a hose over the granite and blade while I cut, about a gallon per foot). Easy to change blades, quick-release levers for adjustments.Cons: Trigger is not very ergonomic, nor is the handle. I wear welding gloves when doing cutting, and have big hands, and there wasn't much room to spare in the grip. The trigger spring weight is very heavy and can get wearying on your finger on long cuts.Simply put, if you want a quality circular saw that's at close to professional level without having to pay exorbitant prices, this is a good bet. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:19:34	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
27363818	I've owned this for a few weeks now and am very happy with it. Highest marks for battery life of course, I work with aluminum and this will put more holes and screws in 1/4 inch stock than any other. Typically lasts a day of fairly steady use on one charge. Also thrilled with the cold weather performance. Doesn't seem to be phased by temps in the single digits unlike NiCad or Lithium and still takes a charge well (my reason for returning my last  new compact tough was horrible low temp performance). Although there are other brands that claim more torque I can't see how, I buried 4 inch lags in a maple log on day one to test it, which I couldn't do with a corded 3/8 chuck. Also seems tough, taken multiple 3 ft falls onto concrete and a 6 fter into snow, though only time will really tell. Only downside is the weight, especially the battery but I feel it's well worth it. Lack of bit holders (except between batt and drill base?!) is inconvenient but glue ons are available. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:19:34	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

34134564	I have other drills-- Porter Cable has been my company of choice. However, this Bostitch Lithium is a serious contender for my favorite. The battery is VERY light and makes things much easier on wrist fatigue. The battery holds a charge for a LONG time-- even longer than my PC tools. I don't know if that is because of the lithium factor, or because they are newer batteries, or because they are just better products.

29840786	Since I think most folks would consider this a major purchase decision for  their shop, I opted to write this review only after I had a chance to  really give it a workout.  I have been using this saw in my shop for about  8 months and must say I have been extremely satisfied with its performance.  I haven't needed to make any adjustments since the intial setup except for  the table saw insert:  small table vibration will change the screw heights  so I recommend you put a drop of epoxy down to hold each of the alan screws  in place.Assembly went fairly well with one hitch.  There are seven  bolts to mount for attaching the front guide rail that holds the rip fence.  Only 6 of the 7 holes aligned correctly, so I have to admit I was cussing  and swearing a bit when the 7th bolt wouldn't go in.  I had to drill and  tap a new hole (6 bolts are probably enough but I was determined to get  that 7th one in), so I was mildly disappointed that Jet's manufacturing  quality let that type of defect slip through.Things I really like:  the  handwheels are big, have a nice feel, and they have very little backplay.  The lock down knobs that hold the saw's height and angle are real secure.  Teflon glides are mounted on the side of the ripfence which gives you a  nice smooth action.  The fence also sits very low on the table - I have no  problem ripping 1/8quot; plywood.  Except for the inductive kick when you  start the motor, its otherwise pretty quiet.  Table vibration is really  minimal, even though I have the saw mounted on a mobile base.Quality  of cutting is superb.  I use thin kerf blades and have cut just about  everything from 1/8quot; ply to 12/4quot; cherry and yes, it cuts like  the proverbial hot knife thru butter.  There is ample power to keep the  blade rpm consistent even through the thick hardwoods - something my 110V  saw could never do.Things that I think could be improved:  though its  fine when locked in place, the rip fence is cumbersome to move especially  when you are making minor adjustments.  I'll rationalize my comment as a  price trade-off.  That's primarily because the fence slides on only the  front guide rail.  The teflon/plastic screw inserts they use to adjust the  heighth and squaring of the fence are a bit tacky - they are hard to turn  and should be made better.  I also think the blade guard can be improved:  to remove it you have to loosen a bolt that's underneath the table insert.  I don't like that because first you have to pull the insert, and second you  have to put a wrench and your hand nearer to the blade - I think there are  good designs out there where the blade guard can be bolted and unbolted  entirely from the outside of the cabinet.  Finally, I'll note that the  primary table top has a bevelled front edge, but the extensions wings do  not.  I can't figure out why they didn't bevel the extensions wings as  well, because you end up with two sharp corners on the front edge of the  table where the extensions wing get mounted.  I ended up filing those  corners down so that there was no possibility of scraping my hands or  potentially marring any wood surface.All totalled, the saw still gets my  5 rating with the comments noted above.  I researched and compared this saw  to several other manufacturers that I concluded cost several hundred  dollars more for the same level of quality and performance.  I also  recommend buying a left tilt saw - I think it's safer because the saw teeth  tilt away from you when doing angled cuts and you're less likely to bind or  kick back the work piece. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:29:45	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes	Performance defect because the rip fence is cumbersome to move especially in minor adjustments.	false
44180337	I was a little skeptical about what this tool would look like for 26 bucks and change! But I must say after using it on  a job, that it performs as well as the expensive ones! We'll have to wait and see about the longevity, but at that price you could buy 3 or 4 replacements! The only changes I would make is on the battery and swivel. I wish it could have a lock on it so when you put it in your tool belt that it would stay facing forward,and it is also kind of hard to get the battery to release from the tool unless you have a very large hand! otherwise it's a great tool for the money. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:29:45	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
50651171	This is a great tool.  It is quiet, very smooth running and well balanced.  It cuts like it has eyes!  I have  a lot of cordless circular saws DeWalt, (2) Milwaukee (1) Craftsman (2) Black  Decker (1) Ryobi (1) Makita (1) Denali (1) and probably a couple I have forgot about.  They range in blade size from around 4 to the 36 volt DeWalt 7  inch.  The Milwaukee is the first saw I reach for when cutting  O.S.B, plywood or 2x or smaller lumber.  The lack of any vibration and the great sight line make it easy to make very precise cuts on a variety of materials.  The stamped aluminum  shoe isn't going to break if you drop it.  It will bend and you can straighten it out unlike a cast aluminum shoe as used on some other saws.  I don't know what else to say, it is a tough saw, it doesn't look very special but it sure does work good.

You'll need a 10mm deep hex socket or an extension,  a ratchet handle or an impact driver to crack the adjustment hex nuts. Is there Lock Tite used in factory assembly as well as an impact? Oh wait there's 10 mm box end on the other end of the arbor wrench, nope..... must for the neck bolts on the engineers who spec'd the bolt sizing. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:32:07	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

29418008	After looking and talking around, and reading various specs, I decided to order this jewel.  Makita makes good equipment.  I have owned a drill motor, and a palm sander... both are still great after 25 years.  I have no complaints about shipping, no broken parts or lacking setup instructional needs.  With very basic awareness, reading the warning tags, and all the included written infomation, on the few the parts to add, it is easy to be up and quietly running in minutes.  There is also instructional material included for initial breakin start up.  My research led me to oil filled lubrication compressor rather than oil free.  Made sense to me, WOW what a difference.  Quiet... like suprisingly quiet for a typically little noise maker tool.  My brother in law has a small similiar, dry run compressor that is much louder and heavier to carry.  I am nearing my leisure years and carrying weight is a concern.  This Makita gem is just over 50 pounds and easy to carry... good balance.  My brother in laws C/H, seems 25 pounds heavier and is very awkward to lift.  My son has to carry that one around.  CAUTION: This is not a commercial unit for running 2 framing nailers.  It is a very well made homeowner /occasional use quiet tool.  It has only one coupler outlet and as I was advised is not for rapid firing framing nailers continuesly.  I have found no problems running any of my air nailers or my framing nailer at a lesuirely pace.  I imagine it could run my impact tools all right, but I have a larger stationary compressor for those.  I am very happy with this portable compressor and the craftmanship it was built with is obvious.  I would have paid more for this unit now that I have mine.  I got a great deal at $157, here on amazon.  I am very satisfied with this tool and delivery.  This tool would be the ultimate for the hobbyists. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:32:07	No Defect		Novice	No		false

27628484	I am extremely handy and no home project is beyond my ability from building decks, electrical work, kitchen remodeling you name it.  As a result I have all manner of power tools:  Table saw, lathe, jig saw, circular saw, Roto-sip, sabre saw, router and many others.  Each tool was designed for a specific task at which it excels but beyond that it can be clumsy doing other tasks, hence the need for another specialized tool.  I recently installed a hardwood floor in my master bath on the second floor.  The room is long and relatively narrow so my 12 chop saw would have been cumbersome to use.  My legs are not what they used to be and I did not relish repeated trips down to my basement workshop to cut the planks.  The Dremel Saw Max seemed like the perfect solution.  Here is my review:1.  I was a little wary that the tool uses a blade that is an abrasive disk without teeth.  Some reviews said that it did not cut well and burned the wood due to the intense friction that accompanies the cutting action.  I made dozens of cuts through 1/2 oak planks with no problem.  The wood cut easily and had a very neat edge with no splinters to sand.  Nice.  The saw cuts fairly quickly but I could see that if you tried to rush the cut things could start smokin'.  Not an issue IMO.2.  Several reviews commented that the depth adjustment did not stay at the adjusted depth setting and that any downward pressure would cause it to slip and cut deeper.  Not sure if they fixed this on this model but I had absolutely no problem with this at all.  I suppose if you pressed down really hard on the tool while cutting this could happen but there is no reason to push the tool that hard against the surface being cut.  Not an issue IMO.3.  The dust attachment is pretty worthless and did not really help reduce the mess.  Kind of like the dust collector on a router, seems like a good idea but really incapable of catching the wood chips and you are still left with a mess.  When you cut wood you make dust and that's a fact Jack.  But, that is why I have a vacuum. Not an issue IMO.4.  In order to keep the unit compact the blade is fairly small.  It has a maximum depth of cut of  which is good enough for the majority of tasks.  I installed new moldings after the floor was installed which was  thick.  When making the 45 degree joints at the corners the cut was 1/16th of an inch shy and so I had to use a manual saw to finish the cut.  Instead I made the measurements and cut the molding on my chop saw in the basement.  A little disappointing because I was hoping I could do all of the cuts while in the bathroom.  Inconvenient, but not a deal breaker.Overall I am very pleased with this tool.  I often need to make straight cuts outdoors or around the house and need to haul my 10 circular saw out to do the job.  I can see where the Saw-Max will be much more convenient.  I like that it can cut metal and tile with the proper blade and hopefully it will complete these tasks as well as it cuts wood.  I will be interested to see how long the abrasive blades last before they need replacement.  I like teeth on my cutting blades because I am a manly man, but I made dozens of cuts through  oak and it cut just as well at the end of my project.I recommend this tool to anyone who needs a compact, versatile and powerful saw to cut a variety of materials safely and effectively. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:34:21	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

55580344	Once again, another hit from Makita.  I use this router bench mounted so I can't comment on the plunge attachment but for bench work, this tool is great.  My original router was a Hitachi that had the bearings wear out (probably my fault for not property adjusting the RPM).  This tool is very powerful and great for routing harder woods with its variable speed control.  The in bench height adjustment is so so, but you can still accurately set it with some tinkering.  I have run many hardwood raised panel cabinet doors through this tool and it has no issues with the larger diameter bits. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:37:29	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

26041681	I am not sure this tool is worth the trouble.  It uses batteries rather quickly, so it isn#8217;t super cheap to operate and isn#8217;t all that environmentally friendly.  Cleaning it and loading/reloading the paint isn#8217;t all that convenient, so overall, I don#8217;t think it saves you much time.  Most importantly, you still have to be careful when painting #8211; this does not make cutting in edges easy #8211; you still have to have a steady hand and be very careful. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:38:46	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

42868339	The chuck works very well, releases and grabs bits perfectly... that is if you are using a real impact driver like me.

36031860	Lots of good reviews of this tool, which I couldn't add to or agree with more.  Fantastic.It is made for the larger Makita 18 volt lithium ion batteries (the 3.0 Amp Hour) but will also work with the smaller 'compact' (1.5 Amp Hour) Makita lithium ion batteries if you make a small modification.  There is a very tiny metal tab on the underside of the tool, in the area where the battery slides in.  Not the big metal tabs which are essential, but a very small one, about 1/8 inch by 1/8 inch, sticking up to one side.  I took a big screwdriver and leveraged it back and forth until the metal weakened and it snapped off.  Now the smaller, lighter battery will slide on.  I did this with another tool (Makita 18 volt grinder) to achieve the same result.  I like the smaller lighter batteries for working on my boat, where projects tend to be short in duration, and getting into tight spots is important.No, I am not recommending you do this.  No, Makita does not recommend this.  So don't write back telling me how this might void the warranty or whatever.  I am just providing the information for those who might have the 'compact' series of tools and wonder if the batteries are interchangeable.20 plus years of using Makita, and I have to say they have consistently led the way with a quality product at a fair price, and a size that fits my small to medium size hands much better than the honking big Dewalt and Milwaukee stuff. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:40:16	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
52978689	This is a very good all purppose router.  Since getting it I have used it both as a standalone router and in my router table.

32089221	Bought this drill while I was rewiring several rooms in my house. Got it to drill through floor joists, and it did just that very well. Compact size with good power.The handle/trigger is tricky, and I unplug it before changing bits or if I'm done using it for awhile. Otherwise you're likely to activate the drill accidentally. Did it once, luckily didn't get hurt.But, the length of the trigger is good for one thing. With 2 x 10 joists, I was able to get the drill bit up into the upper part of the joist without having to stick my hand all the way up there. No keyless chuck, but that may be why it's compact. Keyless chucks are about 2-3 times as long as a keyed chuck, so for size issues, I don't mind it here. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:40:16	Safety Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
32611397	Great product. Nice dial for the speed, with clicks to minimize accidental rotation (although I have inadvertently moved it with a body part once or twice). Choice of two handle attachments, the loop seen in the image or a post with guard like many two-handed drills have. The carrying case is a nice bonus that makes it easier to keep everything together (a few buffing pads plus the polisher). 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:42:10	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
33316654	This is a great sander. I have used it with different grades of sandpaper and the results are the same each time. The palm grip is very comfortable, which makes using it for long periods at a time a simple exercise with no tingling in the hand after use, from vibration. The cannister for collecting the dust fits firmly but easy to remove. It would not vibrate off during use. The pressure indicator is very useful as it helps the user to avoid excessive pressure on the unit, thus enabling the extension of the service life of the sander. However, the sandpaper with which it was shipped loses its grit very soon and would tear easily when sanding corners or edges of the project. Nevertheless, I make no hesitation in recommending this very good performing sander. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:42:10	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

23184401	Another packaging problem. DeWalt went to the trouble to use a good strong carton and even used some extra cardboard in the box but nothing more. I got my planer in pretty good shape except for a broken plastic cover. Then when I called DeWalt they gave me a number to call my nearest service center. I've bought DeWalt before and I'm kind of disappointed with them on this one. Still a decent price for a good planer just have to go through a little more trouble for it. I am happy with the planer itself. I just don't understand why Dewalt won't spend some extra money on packaging rather than extra parts and additional shipping of those parts. Get a clue DeWalt! 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:43:55	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

36448776	I buy the best for my money.  I research for days, and pick the best tool for my application.  I am a serious DIY/rental owner and when my old magnesium-case porter cable 9987 bit the dust, it was time for something new.The Makita LXT got all of the best reviews, most power, best batteries, etc.  Makita, afterall, started as an electric motor manufacturer so I figured it had to be good.I purchased this drill, charged up the battery, and fired it up.  The specs dont lie...it does the job with power to spare...its relatively light weight and comfortable and pushes 3 screws with ease.if you want this drill to do the job, and do it well, go buy it and stop reading this.  If you want to have bought a nice piece of equipment for your money, go buy something else.First off, when you try to feather the motor it whines and you can tell there is a ton of resistance.  Basically it sounds like a cheap kids toy and has very poor motor control.  Trying to do anything technical or fragile will probably drive you nuts, strip a screw, etc.Secondly, like most others say, the chuck is not straight...it wobbles.  Try drilling a 3/16ths hole with a wobbly chuck and you'll quickly learn it doesnt turn out well.  I tried four home depots and all of their models wobbled to some degree.  This is fine for rough work, but for me, this is not acceptable for my money.Given those two concerns, i returned the item and went back to the drawing board.  I played with the DeWalts and realized the chuck wobbles just as much, so that was out.  I finally ended up with the Bosch.  On paper, this is not the strongest or lightest or best drill, but the build quality is excellent and for a remodeler not using this daily, it has handled two remodels and a deck with ease.  Also - the motor is a quality unit, and the chuck is perfectly straight...just like you should expect out of a $200 purchase.Sorry Makita - lost another customer. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:43:55	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
40992360	As I inventoried my new Dremel and all its attachments, I couldn't figure out how to attach the light, even with the diagram in the book.  It appears that the clip on the light is too large for the insertion spot on the Dremel.  I called customer service to inquire as to whether I could have received a light that was meant for a different model or some further instruction on how to attach the light.  The customer service representative was so condescending that I was made to feel like an idiot for not knowing how the light attached and she assured me that it did attach the way the book illustrated and implied that, if I would just use some common sense, I could do it.  I still don't know how the thing attaches and it really isn't a necessary component for most jobs, so I don't know if I care.  The clip is simply larger than the slot it is supposed to go in to.  Otherwise, the tool is fine and works like a champ.  I would have given them 5 stars had it not been for their employee of the month, customer service burn out. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:43:55	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
41905885	I was pleased to find that this new Bosch SN-350 framing nailer lived up to my expectations.  Sturdy - stylish - sleek.I found that the tool body is more narrow than any of my other framing nailers.  This allows me to see where the nail is going more readily.  I bought this because of a video I saw on YouTube explaining this tool's new air flow design.While I expected the tool to be a little lighter, the steel magazine components and overall ruggedness make it well worth a hefty tool at a hefty price. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:46:03	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

39477178	What good is a review if there is no basis for comparison?My previous planer was a decade + old Bosch 3365.  I recently had a bearing on the drum assembly freeze when asking it to do plane not only some extremely dense wood, but a fair thickness of epoxy adhered to its surface which did not cure properly.  I thought I was just sacrificing a blade, not the whole planer.  I've never seen a bearing freeze like this one.  Like a skateboard wheel bearing which just locked up, without obvious contamination.  The planer made no signs it was going to fail, It just locked up, and that was that.Anyway I could have ordered a new drum assembly for 45.xx delivered in a few weeks, or order this PC60thpk for about double that and have it in less than 3 days to complete the job I am working on.To be fair, I never put a straight edge on my old planer.  I did notice it would cut deeper on one side than the other, and that when set at zero depth with a new blade, would still remove material on an already flat surface.So this PC Planer arrives yesterday.  I only plugged it in to make sure the motor spun.  Today I used it on a Slab of Parota, a pretty soft wood.First thing I noticed is that is is slightly heavier than my old planer.  Then I noticed I had to set it to 1/32 depth before the blade would touch the wood, like another reviewer posted.  I didn't have time to investigate, I figured I already used it, and therefore bought it, no returns, unless it were to freeze up instantly.I really don't know whether the High speed steel blades came installed, or the carbide blades.  They are new, they are sharp I have not yet looked further.Second thing I Noticed is that the tone is completely different than my previous Bosch, which only had one Blade on the drum, not two as  does this PC.  The shavings were about half the size and fluffier.  The PC has 20% more power then my Bosch 3365.  I didn't really tax it, and it didn't come close to bogging down with the shallow passes I was taking.It certainly felt different, and I later took my straight edge to the bottom and then started thinking I should have done so before using it.  I hate returning things.The two feet were not parallel until I turned the depth to 1/32.  I noticed at full depth, that one side of the front foot was lower than the opposite side.Adjusting the back foot, the one which does not move is easy, 4 screws hold the foot on, and mine had some thin shims from the factory to adjust it.  However whomever adjusted it had a bad day, or the casing took on a new set since it was adjusted. I got the feet parallel at at 1/32, and later I removed the cover plate on the adjuster knob and was easily able to adjust it so at that at 0 the feet were inline.  This adjustment is simple by popping the cap off the adjuster knob and loosening 3 screws.However at max depth, the left side of the front foot was at least 1/32 deeper than the other side.I've completely disassembled the front foot. Do not lose the little ball bearing which holds the Detents if you so the same.  I have not yet been able to fine tune the front foot so that it retracts evenly beyond 1/32 of an inch.  The left side is always deeper on deeper passes, but shallower depths, it appears parallel side to side.I will work to see if I can fine tune it further.Perhaps I am expecting too much precision. I never checked my old  Bosch planer this closely, but when I disassembled it, I was impressed with the plastic casting, how tightly the 2 halves fit together.  I was torn whether to write it off or fix it. I needed a gear puller to remove the belt sprocket but used a Vice and some significant leverage to remove sprocket and frozen bearing and destroyed the drum in the process.  I was hoping I could just replace the 3$ frozen bearing.  Oh well.The diverter to shoot the removed material to one side or the other does not really fit very tightly and some dust can still exit the undesirable side.  This diverter seems a little flimsy too. My old Bosch design was much burlier in terms of chip ejection, this one seems like an afterthought.The power cord is shorter too.  What I did not need an extension cord with my Bosch, I did for this unit in the same location and workpiece.I also removed the spring loaded safety foot on the back foot.  I was so used to placing the front foot on something elevated that I do not need or want the idiot proof safety feature which might cause the back foot to get caught or warble in the initial pass as it retracts.The feet of this PC unit have a rough base.  It does not slide as easily as my previous Planer.I hope to be able to fine tune it better, or just resign myself to shallow passes of only 1/32 or less, as going deeper, the front foot angles to the side. Nothing that can't be sanded out, but taking a pass with a planer can be taken to a science.  When the accuracy and precision are not there, more sanding is needed, wasting time and making more dust and labor than necessary.When placing a straight edge on the back foot, at full depth, the right side of the foot is just over 2mm deep, the left side just under 2 mm.Edit:I Spent a good amount of time using the unit since above review, but only after a significant more time adjusting it.  I found the shorter power cord to be annoying.  The extension kept getting stuck and in the way, slowing down passes and causing some cursing fits.  I might replace it with a longer one.One thing I did not realize is the depth of the blades themselves are adjustable on the drum. My old Bosch the blade was removable and was locked Via 2 allen grub screw.  This PC has the 2 grub screws, but they are to set the depth of the blade in the drum.  3 other 5/16(estimated) Nuts hold the blade into the drum at the height allowed by the recessed Allen key grub screws.With both feet in the same plane, I found the blades were uneven in relation to each other.  My former adjustments above had me gouging uneven lines on a test board and I spent a considerable time tuning it in So that 0 depth was not cutting down anything but high spots.  The foot still retracts unevenly above 1/32I have no idea if the blades installed in it from the factory were the HSS or carbide, but once I tuned it in and took it to a Piece of relatively soft wood, I felt the blades had already lost their edge.  The tool was nowhere near struggling, but it was not cutting as cleanly, and I had to go real slow to not leave ridges.  I wonder if one blade is intended to be set deeper than the other blade.  Mine were kind of crooked from the factory and I set them both the same height and am now wondering if crooked or uneven height was intentional and desirable for cleaner stock removal. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:46:03	No Defect		Expert	No		false
27009363	The ordering process was fine and the lathe arrived quickly.  I did have to go to UPS to pick it up due to the fact my farm was not accessible by tractor -trailer.  UPS would not deliver with a panel truck.Assembly was straight forward and easy to do.  A second persons certainly helps with the assembly, weight of the parts being the major issue here.Turned a small 8.5 no problems moved up to a 10 bowl bout 3 inches deep...started to notice some vibration. at one point the head-stock vibrated into the tool rest and chipped the bowl edge. I tighten everything back up and finished the bowl.Next I started a 11 x 5 walnut bowl...this size of bowl is what I bought this lathe for.  Right off I had some heavy vibration (note I had rounded the blank on my band saw before placing on the lathe).  I assumed that it must be off center a bit so I fought through rounding/balancing the blank. The vibration did not get any better in fact seem to get worse over time.  I could not get a clean cut on the blank due to the vibration.  The head-stock came loose repeatedly.  I finally stopped working the bowl and wrapped in a trash bag until I could figure out the problem.After some research I decided to bolt the lathe to the floor.  In addition, I added a shelf under the lathe and placed 300lbs of sand bags on the shelf.  I was certain  this would solve my issue...not to be. I experienced the same vibrations and head-stock coming loose. I stopped turning the blank and wrapped it up again.Time to call Grizzly tech support.  They did not know what to make of this problem and asked me to take a video of what was going on and send it to them.  Here is the link to the video on youtube. http://youtu.be/VlofFQ9Psfc if you want to see what I'm taking about.It's been three days now with nothing but an email saying they will get back to me.  Called today to get an update and was told I'll get a call back today.  Sure hope so.My hope is Grizzly can make this right.  The lathe is a great price for a 2HP motor which I assumed would work for larger bowls.  I should have known better than to go with one of the cheapest lathes on the market.  Seemed to good to be true...and is was.  I'll post a follow-up once Grizzly gets back with me and hopefully resolves the problem.  But for now my recommendation is to avoid this lathe.Update 6/26/13After 3 days of calling I talked to the right person at tech support.  After reviewing they said they had never seen anything like this.  And will be sending me a new head-stock. I will update again once received and tested.Update 7/10/2013Got the new head-stock in and installed. Tried turning the same bowl blank...while the vibration was reduced a great deal it still is too much to turn the bowl.  Changing speeds was much easier than on the original head-stock.  Tried for about 30 mins to get a good cut but it is not to be.  I was really hoping this would fix the problem.  The price was great for a lathe this size...but I should have know it was too good to be true.  Any way I have contacted Grizzly and requested to return for a refund. Still waiting on a response. Now I need to decide on another lathe.  Any ideas...I want to be able to turn bowl 12-15 inches. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:46:03	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

I have had mine for 9+ years and it is a true as the day I bought it.  I do wish that it beveled both ways, but can work around that.

52058138	Received boxed product all good. Had to buy a nipple for the air attachment, (not attached or included). Bought that and while tightening it into place I snapped the housing for the nipple. I didn't cross-thread or over-torque it. I needed the gun for a job immediately and went to a nearby repair shop and store. They told me it would be three weeks until their next Senco order went out and longer for the repair. So I bought a Hitachi which I am very happy with right out of the box. Having the Senco fixed and may keep it despite the hassle. Wasted several hours and am disappointed with the flimsy casting. I imagine that I caught a bad break and that the gun would satisfy many that don't have this misfortune, but who has the time for junk and trouble? I always aim to buy the best and would gladly pay a bit more for better craftsmanship if given the choice. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:50:04	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
33335490	I used this to frame my unfinished basement.  I was driving 3.5 screws with this tool without problems.  It has plenty of power.  The LED is also a great feature, and was very handy.  I could drive maybe 40 or so screws before my 1.5 Ah battery started to fade.  I may upgrade to the LXT batteries to get longer battery life.

38112280	The saw is great. It has all the power you will ever need for any wood or composite trim work. And I've used mine for very heavy work including cutting old and very dry 1 solid oak old barn floors. The stand is excellent for portable work. Although I will warn that the extensions aren't very tight, so don't count on them for a square cut. When folded the legs act as arms for a 2-person carry. Therein does lie one other criticism. It's a big large and akward for a single person. So consider a smaller saw without a stand if you work alone and have to carry it around. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:51:27	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
27760005	I got one of these yesterday and immediately took it back. I am a woodworker by hobby and needed to do particular sanding. I found the packaging excellent, but that's where it stops. Yes it sands. The verticle plate in back of the 1quot; belt was 1/4 inch to the left and cannot be adjusted. It was also bent back 15 degrees and not flush to the belt. The throat is not deep, so, sanding a part of a piece of wood longer that a 10 inches cannot be done. Metal parts were jagged and dangerous, especially the little tables. The miter gauge with the disk sander table is small and wobbled in the miter slot and therefore useless for any specific angle of cut. All in all a very cheesy product. If a straight line or a 90 degree angle is of any interest to a user, leave this product on the shelf. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:51:27	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

25986584	This is an outstanding product that exceeds the manufacturers claims.  Dust is limited to almost nothing.  I used it for sanding after scraping popcorn off the ceiling.  If you are living in the house while remodeling, this is a must-have tool.  Of course everything depends on the two stage filtering of the attached vaccum cleaner. I have rented the tool with the Porter Cable vaccum in the past and it worked great.  I used my own vaccum with high efficiency filter and a bag and also worked great.  The sander controlled Porter Cable vaccum is a plus. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:53:05	No Defect		Novice	No		false
30552927	I've been a building contractor for 25 years and I've always used heavy-duty worm gear saws, but I bought this saw for my daughter when I helped her remodel her condo.  I found I liked it better than my own saw for most work.  No, I wouldn't recommend it for a tradesman or for heavy framing, but for a homeowner it's terrific.  I love the site light.  Had no trouble cutting straight lines, cutting at an angle, notching, whatever.  I just ordered a second one - for my son.

22580894	I really like the soft start feature that totally eliminates the torque jerk when turning on. The up and down motion is not smooth at all. I find it takes quite a good force to start the plunge motion down and when it finally starts down you can smash the turning bit in too fast. I find that I have to use the knob in front to start the plunge to prevent this. Using the knob to start the plunge will prevent the jerk. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:53:05	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

57930249	This unit is a cheap way to get into a belt sander and it seems to be of reasonable quality.  I've purchased several recon tools from assorted online sellers and have no regrets:  they've performed well.  But, recons are not always a smart choice.  Home Depot, for example, is an exclusive outlet for Ryobi tools.  They sometimes offer full warranty new tools for LESS than a recon tool.Be sure to check around for pricing on this one.  Shipping charges through this seller are excessive and, since it does not qualify for free shipping, you'll likely do better elsewhere.Very happy with this sander but I did not buy it on Amazon. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:54:40	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
54264581	An excellent tool for installing hardwood flooring, especially a sand in place floor.  I suggest getting the wider softer shoe kit for laminates and engineered hardwoods to prevent scratches in the finish.  I am 2000 square feet into this nailer with no jams, but I use cleats from Primatech out of Canada, the glue holding the clips together is stronger and more flexible than the PortaNails cleats,  they stay in one strand rather than breaking up, making loading much quicker. Being a general contractor and not a flooring contractor means my nailer will only see occasional use rather than e everyday, I believe this to be the perfect balance between cost and quality! 	muellerp	10-23-2015 08:54:40	No Defect		Expert	No		false
28084682	This is a very powerful tool which accurately and quickly cuts.  Coupled with the Progressor wood cutting blade, my first project with it was a pleasure.  I even experimented with a couple of cuts that I normally would have used a circular saw or hand saw and was not disappointed.  Along with the fact that it is a powerful machine is the fact that it gets quite warm under load where I rest my hand for guiding.

59319243	Variable speed, reversible, locking and indexing spindle, what's not to like?  After setup, did have to turn it on and let it run for about 45 minutes to break in the motor, but that wasn't any big deal.  I did extend the feet under the headstock out on a 10 inch piece of angle iron, 4 inches on center was just too narrow to apply much pressure at the spindle.  Other than that modification, this is a big step up from my old Jet 10x14 VS with no reverse or locking spindle.  I've only turned a few things, so far, but it is living up to all my expectations.  Only uncorrectable complaint is the short throw on the tail stock screw, which is half that of the old Jet.

44449213	I got it brand new from Home Depot last week. I bought it because I need a nailer to build my shed and I have heard Senco is the nailer of pro choice, and I expect you get what you pay for as this model is not cheap.It only shoot less than 600 2 3/8 nails in the week. It jamed once in the first 100 shots. (OK to me.) Then the problem started developing more seriously. At the end, it jammed 3 times in 10 minutes. I couldn't continue my work. I hammered some nails manually and send the unit back to Home Depot.BTW, I bought Hitachi NR83A from HD afterward. It is very reliable, lighter than the above Senco, and even...cheaper.

40393336	Upon reading all the reviews on this both good and bad, it is a mediocre product. I picked mine up from a woodworking store 5 or 6 years ago and had no issues with packaging and assembling per everyone elses problems. My issues were the lever would bind half way down while trying to drill through and once I started drilling it was rather tough going. After many mortises the piece where the lever connected to the motor broke into pieces and it did take quite a while to get a replacement. I do agree that the hp is not quite enough for drilling through hard woods like maple or oak. Many mortises have been made since my purchase but I just deal with with the binding...you get what you pay for I guess. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 09:02:21	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

57230037	This is my first Rigid tool purchase.  I have owned 2 different DeWalt 3 x 21 sanders in the past 10 years or so.  They were very well made with good balance - had to set platen adjustment in/out for each belt change.  I looked at the new DeWalt 3 x 21 sander  don't care for the weight or balance of it.This Rigid belt sander soft-start takes a little getting used to, but the tool works great.  Nice balance with a long power cord  dust collection bag works much better than the DeWalt sanders that I have used in the past. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 09:08:14	No Defect		Novice	No		false

36717991	I currently have several comparable electric screw drivers I keep around the house. But this one added some new features that none of the other screw drivers had, so I decided to add this one to the collection to see how well it did. So far, it has worked quite well.As far as power, this is your standard BD; 3.6V rechargable screw driver and is about on par with the competition. For light duties around the house, it'll do just fine. Just keep in mind these aren't drills or high powered screw drivers. If you find that it runs out of power, you probably need a more powerful unit.The light works. But just barely. It's not very bright, but does help out in certain situations. It will also dim if the screw driver starts to have to work harder than usual. It also features a swivel adjustment so it can be used as a normal straight screw driver or at an angle as pictured. However, since it is rather bulky in either configuration, I normally just kept it in the angle position.It's very easy to grip and hold on to thanks to the rubber moldings at key locations. It's also light weight and even has a place for 1 extra bit. Battery life, also right about average for other BD; 3.6v screw drivers. Just charge it up over night and it'll last quite awhile. Li-Ion would be nice, but that would also cost a lot more. For basic use around the house, fast charge times and super long life aren't a priority. At least not with this model!One important feature that's missing is a torque setting. This prevents me from using it with more sensitive electronics where even 3.6V can be too much. But at this price point, I guess you can't expect too much!Pros:* Built-in Light* 2 Angle Adjustement* Descent battery life* Rechargable battery* Powerful enough for most jobs around the houseCons:* No Torque Setting* Somewhat bulkyOverall considering it's price and features, I would recommend this screw driver. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 09:11:23	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
64662780	It's advertisement leads you to believe it is suitable for #34;professional#34; work; therefore I bought it for cutting protruding nails from pieces of lumber on a daily basis.

47524769	I use a $200 Bosch saw at work. This performs nearly as well. I have read other reviews on this saw which leave me a little confused. If you want a saw to make square neat cuts in 2x4 #8216;s a jig saw is not the right tool. This cuts very well in all materials that I have used it on. The tool less blade changing is very handy. My favorite feature is the visibility. This saw allows you to view the blade as you cut by looking directly down at it. I have not seen another saw at any price that does this. For the price this is an excellent tool for the average home owner doing general projects. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 09:16:57	No Defect		Expert	No		false
25333947	Yup, another high quality/high priced tool accessory from Festool.  If you do much edge routering with a Festool router, you need this to make the router more stable when it is hanging over the edge of the workpiece.

41786783	The lights on this grinder are better than those I've seen at home improvement stores. It arrived in a timely manner and works well. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that if you are grinding something with a handle, such as a hatchet, the design of double grinding stones makes it hard to grind both sides of the hatchet. The reason? The handle can't move because of the proximity of the second stone. Anything with a handle longer than the distance between the two stones isn't going to work well. Otherwise, a great product. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 09:16:57	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
53910740	I have been a remodel contractor for 30+ years .  I recently bought the Bosch MX25EK which is so-so in my opinion.  It is underpowered for a contractor except for occasional use.  The cost of the blades far exceeds their value and they wear out quickly often lasting only one or two cuts.  At $10+ for blades, use a reciprocating saw when you can. Sometimes, the size and action of the Bosch makes it worthwhile for those hard to get to places.  A handpowered, undercut saw, works faster for door trim.  It works well as a detail sander.  If you think you are going to be using it a lot, either buy a Fein, or the more expensive, heavy duty Bosch. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 09:16:57	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
48684376	I have had my sander now for nearly 3 years.  i have beat the crap out of it sanding  very large projects.  i replaced the brushes once.  tracking has been fairly good with the belts. the only problem is it heating up.  good to use in the winter--it keeps your hand warm.  otherwise i hold it by the front handle and the cord as the body is too hot to hold.  for what i use it for  there is no other sander on the market i could switch to, so i will buy another when this one finally dies (it is on it's way).  i will give it a proper burial as it has been a fine assistant in my work.  if they could fix the heating up issue they would have a great little sander. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 09:19:15	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
29502234	I purchased this combo set at a tool show and returned it the next day.  Problems being that some parts were missing and the plastic portion on the plunge base was cracked.  I am sure they would have exchanged it, but it doesn't say much for future durability.  Dewalt is usually great.  I have a lot of their stuff.  I'm sure they will get this combo set right with a few more months under their belt.  In the meantime I picked up the Bosch - It seems more durable, came with a great edge guide and is a pleasure to work with. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 09:19:15	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
50632420	Used a Dewalt DWD210G drill with it. First project was turning some bocote to make grips for an antique bicycle. For the price, this thing can't be beat. Only thing I wish it could do (though, I realize wouldn't happen at this price point) is having one or both carriages riding on a lead screw instead of just sliding on the aluminum channel. Would have made boring the centers on these grips far less aggravating (thankfully, polyurethane Gorilla Glue is also a great product!). 	muellerp	10-23-2015 09:19:15	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
29492383	I love DeWalt tools they seem to be always over the top on design, versatility and ease of use. I had bought this drill with batteries and charger several months back and really had not a chance to use until yesterday. I pulled out drill and charger and grabbed a battery to charge, put in charger and left for about 4 hours, came back still no charge, swapped batteries out and had the other batterycharged within 45 minutes. I went and finished my project, came back to charge the other battery, still dead the next day and even into late evening. I would have given a 5 star but I want what I pay for. Very disappointed.

56687289	The Skil SHD77 worm drive saw is a powerful brute, and it is heavy enough to prove it, that cuts through even wet, pressure-treated wood with ease. With the right blade this saw cuts clean and true, it did not bog down or burn the wood at any point. Over the past 35 years I have had to buy 7 electric circular saws and all of them are dead (motors burned out, brushes worn and not replaceable, or trigger switches burned out.) I expect this Skil worm drive saw to be around and working as long as I will be.

48276491	With virtually all products, you can find negative comments. So honestly I was a little reluctant to buy this lathe due to some concerns i read. However, in a similar price point are the Harbor Freight lathes and I read some pretty scary reviews on those lathes. But on this lathe, the price was unbeatable, and if ordered through Amazon the $50 shipping charge from the vendor didn't apply...and I needed a lathe to finish my tall case clock that needed columns in the hood. So I took a chance and bought this lathe. I was surprised at the quality, performance and delivery time. I love this little guy. It's surprisingly heavy for it's size and contrary to other reviews, I had no problem accessing the belt for speed changes. And by the way, it was dead on accurate. I invested in a couple quality turning tools and I turned my walnut columns for the clock without effort. My next project requires turing 29 cherry legs so I'll be buying the extension. If you're looking for a small lathe and you're on a limited budget, in my opinion this is the best value out there. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 09:22:54	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

24897905	As a commercial contractor I need tools to perform as I expect them too, and this multitool does that very well.No, it won't keep up or have the same power as my Fien.  It isn't supposed to.  Yet, it just ripped 3/4#34; oak trim for about 16#34; in a hospital lobby light deck.  And did it on an already used battery.  So it has the ability to be a brute if needed.  The right blade, the right rpm, and it flew through that light deck with zero smoke.  Can't, it was a functioning hospital.I often use this when cutting the strike box out of metal door frames to fit electronic strikes.  Again, the correct speed with the right blade, and this PS50 is great.  Extremely precise and controllable.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the quality of the PS50. 	muellerp	10-23-2015 09:22:54	No Defect		Expert	No		false

39474703	Was given to me for a Father's day gift.  I am a Mechanic/Locksmith for a institution.  Works great for what I do.  Can go really slow if needed for easy work or fast if you turn more.  The battery life seems to be awesome and very handy.  Actually has a lot of torque however that is not why I suggested or even my need.  I do wish however there was a pocket or belt sheath or pouch since it doesn't quite fit in a pocket but easily a tool pouch.  Also Amazon had the best price anywhere.

27648346	I purchased this product specifically to tear down a small engine for a race car we're building.  It's very handy and light and will loosen most bolts and hex fasteners but lacks the torque I was hoping for.  Regardless it has become a very useful tool and speeds the assembly  disassembly for most of the applications I expect to use it for.  Plusses are its small size and light weight.  The extra battery is good also.  As a week-end warrior with a semi professional shop I would recommend this tool, however for every day use, you may want to seek out a more powerful product.Also, it's made in Mexico, which is not great but a hell of a lot better than the Chinese crap that's all over the market.

It needed some slight adjustments initially, but after a few minutes with a square and a wrench, it cuts perfectly.  I also added a laser for added ease.

36663244	This is a medium duty air tool and should be treated that way.  It appears to be well made and while I have not used it extensively, I have tested it with different size brads and material, without a problem.  It is easy to load and use in most situations and is very efficient in it's use of air.  Upon receipt of the unit, the small oil bottle cap was loose and had spilled most of the oil into the case.  I emailed CH Customer service to get a part # so I could order some more oil.  I was advised to just go out and buy some air compressor oil and use that. This was VERY BAD advice, as this is an oil that may contain detergents.  The instruction manual states to NOT use anything but NON-Detergent oil as detergents will destroy the seals.

The plastic frame seemed a little light when I bought it, but I bolted it to a workbench right away, and it's been a champ.  It's really handy for sanding in those hard to reach places that would be real finger breakers (of which there are many in my work; I'm a luthier). The table top is metal, and feels pretty solid enough.  Before this I used those sanding drums that mounted to a drill press; this is a LOT better.

39477178	What good is a review if there is no basis for comparison?My previous planer was a decade + old Bosch 3365.  I recently had a bearing on the drum assembly freeze when asking it to do plane not only some extremely dense wood, but a fair thickness of epoxy adhered to its surface which did not cure properly.  I thought I was just sacrificing a blade, not the whole planer.  I've never seen a bearing freeze like this one.  Like a skateboard wheel bearing which just locked up, without obvious contamination.  The planer made no signs it was going to fail, It just locked up, and that was that.Anyway I could have ordered a new drum assembly for 45.xx delivered in a few weeks, or order this PC60thpk for about double that and have it in less than 3 days to complete the job I am working on.To be fair, I never put a straight edge on my old planer.  I did notice it would cut deeper on one side than the other, and that when set at zero depth with a new blade, would still remove material on an already flat surface.So this PC Planer arrives yesterday.  I only plugged it in to make sure the motor spun.  Today I used it on a Slab of Parota, a pretty soft wood.First thing I noticed is that is is slightly heavier than my old planer.  Then I noticed I had to set it to 1/32 depth before the blade would touch the wood, like another reviewer posted.  I didn't have time to investigate, I figured I already used it, and therefore bought it, no returns, unless it were to freeze up instantly.I really don't know whether the High speed steel blades came installed, or the carbide blades.  They are new, they are sharp I have not yet looked further.Second thing I Noticed is that the tone is completely different than my previous Bosch, which only had one Blade on the drum, not two as  does this PC.  The shavings were about half the size and fluffier.  The PC has 20% more power then my Bosch 3365.  I didn't really tax it, and it didn't come close to bogging down with the shallow passes I was taking.It certainly felt different, and I later took my straight edge to the bottom and then started thinking I should have done so before using it.  I hate returning things.The two feet were not parallel until I turned the depth to 1/32.  I noticed at full depth, that one side of the front foot was lower than the opposite side.Adjusting the back foot, the one which does not move is easy, 4 screws hold the foot on, and mine had some thin shims from the factory to adjust it.  However whomever adjusted it had a bad day, or the casing took on a new set since it was adjusted. I got the feet parallel at at 1/32, and later I removed the cover plate on the adjuster knob and was easily able to adjust it so at that at 0 the feet were inline.  This adjustment is simple by popping the cap off the adjuster knob and loosening 3 screws.However at max depth, the left side of the front foot was at least 1/32 deeper than the other side.I've completely disassembled the front foot. Do not lose the little ball bearing which holds the Detents if you so the same.  I have not yet been able to fine tune the front foot so that it retracts evenly beyond 1/32 of an inch.  The left side is always deeper on deeper passes, but shallower depths, it appears parallel side to side.I will work to see if I can fine tune it further.Perhaps I am expecting too much precision. I never checked my old  Bosch planer this closely, but when I disassembled it, I was impressed with the plastic casting, how tightly the 2 halves fit together.  I was torn whether to write it off or fix it. I needed a gear puller to remove the belt sprocket but used a Vice and some significant leverage to remove sprocket and frozen bearing and destroyed the drum in the process.  I was hoping I could just replace the 3$ frozen bearing.  Oh well.The diverter to shoot the removed material to one side or the other does not really fit very tightly and some dust can still exit the undesirable side.  This diverter seems a little flimsy too. My old Bosch design was much burlier in terms of chip ejection, this one seems like an afterthought.The power cord is shorter too.  What I did not need an extension cord with my Bosch, I did for this unit in the same location and workpiece.I also removed the spring loaded safety foot on the back foot.  I was so used to placing the front foot on something elevated that I do not need or want the idiot proof safety feature which might cause the back foot to get caught or warble in the initial pass as it retracts.The feet of this PC unit have a rough base.  It does not slide as easily as my previous Planer.I hope to be able to fine tune it better, or just resign myself to shallow passes of only 1/32 or less, as going deeper, the front foot angles to the side. Nothing that can't be sanded out, but taking a pass with a planer can be taken to a science.  When the accuracy and precision are not there, more sanding is needed, wasting time and making more dust and labor than necessary.When placing a straight edge on the back foot, at full depth, the right side of the foot is just over 2mm deep, the left side just under 2 mm.Edit:I Spent a good amount of time using the unit since above review, but only after a significant more time adjusting it.  I found the shorter power cord to be annoying.  The extension kept getting stuck and in the way, slowing down passes and causing some cursing fits.  I might replace it with a longer one.One thing I did not realize is the depth of the blades themselves are adjustable on the drum. My old Bosch the blade was removable and was locked Via 2 allen grub screw.  This PC has the 2 grub screws, but they are to set the depth of the blade in the drum.  3 other 5/16(estimated) Nuts hold the blade into the drum at the height allowed by the recessed Allen key grub screws.With both feet in the same plane, I found the blades were uneven in relation to each other.  My former adjustments above had me gouging uneven lines on a test board and I spent a considerable time tuning it in So that 0 depth was not cutting down anything but high spots.  The foot still retracts unevenly above 1/32I have no idea if the blades installed in it from the factory were the HSS or carbide, but once I tuned it in and took it to a Piece of relatively soft wood, I felt the blades had already lost their edge.  The tool was nowhere near struggling, but it was not cutting as cleanly, and I had to go real slow to not leave ridges.  I wonder if one blade is intended to be set deeper than the other blade.  Mine were kind of crooked from the factory and I set them both the same height and am now wondering if crooked or uneven height was intentional and desirable for cleaner stock removal. 	winp0007	10-23-2015 14:51:59	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
39888893	Once the bolts are installed  it is real easy to remove and install the tables. They do fold up but they are easier to remove than have them fold down while carrying the planer.

37193234	So far i've disposed of a two old trees ,  using the the hitachi it had more then enough power to get the job done easily.The only PLUS MINUS i could find was with the trigger - it was so light to the pull - causing me some concern about how easy it would be to accidently start up when not intending to cut anything. Which happened several times when i was trying to reposition and then hang the tool from its grip. But when actually cutting the easy trigger was a plus.Just be extra cautious is what i'm saying about the trigger . Overall  a great deal ! 	winp0007	10-23-2015 14:57:55	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

54264581	An excellent tool for installing hardwood flooring, especially a sand in place floor.  I suggest getting the wider softer shoe kit for laminates and engineered hardwoods to prevent scratches in the finish.  I am 2000 square feet into this nailer with no jams, but I use cleats from Primatech out of Canada, the glue holding the clips together is stronger and more flexible than the PortaNails cleats,  they stay in one strand rather than breaking up, making loading much quicker. Being a general contractor and not a flooring contractor means my nailer will only see occasional use rather than e everyday, I believe this to be the perfect balance between cost and quality! 	winp0007	10-23-2015 14:57:55	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
44946913	First off I'd like to tell you I ordered my Replicator 2 from Autodesk not here on Amazon.  There was a special offer with access to their site  so I ordered it there Big Big mistake,  not that ordering the machine here would of been any better since its a piece of junk to start with.  I ordered mine February 16th and received it about a week later and have been trying to get the thing to actually work correctly since.First thing out of the box was the front cooling fan did not come on, no big deal things happen during shipping, so I contacted their support, told them the fan did not work,so they sent me a new control board saying that they thought this was the problem along with a  new fan just in case.  I thought cool they are really on the ball I'll be up and running in no time.... not really, it took a week to get the first parts they sent me after installing the new board and fan I started it up and still had the same problem no front fan, so I checked the wiring and there I found that whoever assembled this machine crushed all the wires completely in half no connectivity at all, contacted support again telling them the problem and waited another week to get replacement wiring and cooling fan that had been crushed as well as front fan wires.All I could think was wow this is the industry leader and this is the junk they let out their door?First it had to go through some kind or quality control and be tested, so again someone dropped the ball their since the wires were cut the fan could not of worked  during this process. and it still made it out their door and to mine,  I'm sorry thats NOT an Industry Leader thats chinese junkSo I received the parts and installed them, but, wait still no front fan again, by this point I have lost a major job and the customer who placed the order so I'm not really happy with my new $2400.00 purchase ( $2100.00 for the makerbot and another $350.00 for the warranty).  The tech  person helping me was the only redeeming quality of this product since he had a few more ideas and after another round of testing we found that I had received another bad control board from them.  They tested the board that was originally sent in my replicator 2 and found that it was bad as was the one shipped to me so he sends me another control board and again I wait a week to receive it and install it and finally have a working machine after just over a month of working on it.Now this is a company that promotes itself as the Industry leader in 3d printing, I have worked with several industry leaders (In other fields) and have never had these kinds of issues or wait times for parts this is what I expect out of cheap knockoff junk ordered out of china at a cut rate price.  If this would've happened with an industry leader I wouldn't of had to wait a week between finding the problem and getting parts and they would of offered some kind of incentive or compensation for all the trouble and to keep me as a customer.  Makerbot says its working so there you go happy printing.I'm sorry  I waited so long to post this but wanted to wait for the anger to go away a little before writing this.  I understand that this is a new field and new tech and that its going to have some problems to start with but that should not be in the assembly of the product. this is a 3rd rate product be careful when purchasing since it doesn't come with a warranty.

55048251	We've used Paslode Impulse Nailers for our framing crew since they first came out.  We still have some of our first guns, from nearly ten years ago.  Our crew is not easy on tools, so the tools have not been babied.  The  newer guns are not as good and the service sometimes leaves a lot to be  desired.  When I have complained to the reps I'm told that the tool is not  for everyday framing, just for occasional use where pnuematic tools are  inconvienent.  This is what the retailers don't tell you when you buy them.  They are not supposed to be a primary tool -- but that's how we use them  anyway.  We've learned to implement most repairs and cleaning on the job.  It would be nice if Paslode would make the guns so they SHOULD be the  primary tool. 	winp0007	10-23-2015 15:00:07	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
55516574	I would say that I'm an occasional Do-it-yourselfer from Mililani, Hawaii but this combo kit from Makita just blew me away.  I can't believe the technological advances of their product since my first Makita cordless, a 9.6 Volt Drill-Driver 20 years ago-and I still have it.  You'd expect an 18 volt cordless tool to be very bulky, but the tools in this kit are compact, very ergonomic, well balanced and not bulky.  You won't be wasting energy, straining to work the tools.  You'll also appreciate LED lighting on the all the tools.  The power and torque behind the Circular Saw, Impact Driver and Hammer Driver-Drill are impressive compared to other brands I've tried.  The free mail-in offer for the Cordless Reciprocating Saw was impressive too.  It packed power just as my corded Reciprocating Saw.  The High Capacity Lithium-Ion Batteries did not fail me.  They packed a lot of juice and lasted a while in between charges.  Also, I came to appreciate the 4-Position Flashlight.  With all the rain that we've been having lately, the flashlight came in handy during blackouts.  I didn't need to bringout my gas lantern; flashlight supplied all the light we needed. Overall, the tools performed flawlessly and I had joy using them.  This 18 Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless Combo Kit from Makita is truly a great product.

I even experimented with a couple of cuts that I normally would have used a circular saw or hand saw and was not disappointed.  Along with the fact that it is a powerful machine is the fact that it gets quite warm under load where I rest my hand for guiding.

Would be nice if it came with one stone and one wire brush instead of two stones but that would probably add a little to the cost. It seems to be well balanced and runs smoothly, very little vibration or tendency to #34;walk#34; and I do not even have it secured to the bench.

It appears that the clip on the light is too large for the insertion spot on the Dremel.  I called customer service to inquire as to whether I could have received a light that was meant for a different model or some further instruction on how to attach the light.  The customer service representative was so condescending that I was made to feel like an idiot for not knowing how the light attached and she assured me that it did attach the way the book illustrated and implied that, if I would just use some common sense, I could do it.  I still don't know how the thing attaches and it really isn't a necessary component for most jobs, so I don't know if I care.  The clip is simply larger than the slot it is supposed to go in to.  Otherwise, the tool is fine and works like a champ.

45166564	This is a little gem of a polisher!!  It is lightweight and very easy to handle.  And the price is reasonable.  I'm not much of a car buff -- but even I found this fun and easy to use.  Though it does take some time to cover a large surface.Drawbacks -- the cord is kind of short -- but that's easily remedied with an extension cord, and you probably wouldn't want a super long cord on such a small appliance.  My other gripe-- the little polishing bonnets were pretty hard to get on and off.

It seemed a little cheap, but I probably wouldn't have worn it even if it was top quality so it's not an issue for me. 	hyerin94	10-24-2015 22:30:32	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

39858298	My husband wanted a sliding mitre saw, and for the price, you can't beat this.

52470665	I bought this drill for 6 months ago, and purposely using for tulip planning, I bought this drill and bought an auger. Now, It burned out. In a manner book, said warranty for 2 years, so I called the manufacturer and they said this drill are not designed to drill holes on dirts. I said  Really. So you bought the expensive drill for little uses on something else? And the customer was careless about this, and they don't care. I feel bad for this business. 	hyerin94	10-24-2015 22:55:55	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

22591882	I'll start out saying l aways loved Senco products. I purchased this over a year ago and only used it once on a home project for 6 nails (I was going to use it more for home projects and hobbies when I retired). Then today I went to use it on another project and after charging the battery, the battery was proofed defective (like other reviewers battery's).  Went and purchased new battery (at nearly $100.00) figuring that would take care of problem it didn't. The nailer it self has also become defective sitting in the hard case unused since the day I used it for 6 nails. Would not recommend. Truly disappointed. 	hyerin94	10-24-2015 22:58:49	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
31528311	when i upgraded my bosh 18v to dewalt 20v, i was under the impression that at least within a year dewalt 20v will have far more tools than what they have now. WRONG!  they had me fooled, i have no idea what taking them this long to make more tools in 20v... so if you're a handyman and trying to upgrade to 20v, think again because they only have few tools in 20v and it seems like something stopping them from making new variety of tools in 20v..as a result i have to carry both bosh and dewalt tools with me and its very inconvenient at the job site to find  2 outlets to charge both batteries at the same time.. 	hyerin94	10-24-2015 22:58:49	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

The description does say it comes with a case, which, in my mind, should mean a hard-sided container. The canvas bag that does come with it is not as protective as I would like but the saw is still a good buy. 	hyerin94	10-24-2015 23:02:04	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
31376827	My Harbor Freight 29 dollar buffer died.  I liked it.  Brush's went and could not get them replaced.  It had a handle on it, and other things.  When I went back to HF, they no longer carried it and none had a handle.  Use it on my boat in the water, handle is a good think.  The Kawasaki is the identical product, just green and costs 3x more.  Works great, but way too expensive.

62272716	I recently bought this saw and must say it is amazing.  You can cut indoors!!  I am a contractor (15 yrs in business) specializing in bathrooms and must cut tiles in cold temps in winter. if you have experienced in wet saws you know they can make quite the mess when you cut indoors in a basement and tend to freeze over while cutting outdoors in cold temps.  This saw has almost no spray off.  The water is shot down the tray and picked up by the blade from under the tile.  They also have a more traditional spray directly on the blade from under the blade guard that is volume adjustable to give you only the amount of water you need.  I just tiled a 10' tall 4'x5' custom standing shower, 100sqft. floor, and tub deck and surround indoors with very little clean up.  It is very light weight and so far i haven't even see the motor overload safety led light even flicker.  I have been using a pearl abrasive saw for over ten years( also a great saw) and was amazed how much lighter this saw is than my old one.  I can't speak to the longevity of the saw but it cuts straight and is very innovative.  Only complaint is that there should be a better system of running the hoses to saw from pump.  The lines kinda get bunched up in the water tray. I bought the saw locally so no comment on shipping, and as far as setup goes it took me and my crew about 25min from box to up and running. great saw for professionals, probably too much saw for your average homeowner. I hope it lasts as long as my pearl abrasive. 	hyerin94	10-24-2015 23:02:04	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
23743233	My wife bought this tool on clearance, w/o packaging or instructions for $14.  We couldn't install blades.  Thanks to the guy who offered the Plier Trick.  To quote my wife, That guy saved you.To expand on his instructions:  If you can push the black button that moves the locking pin in and out, you need to do the trick.  Get needle nose pliers or a flat head screwdriver.  Push the black button, which extends the locking pin.  Insert a screwdriver or pliers through the hole on the opposite side and turn the end of that pin 90 degrees.  At this point, it should not retract completely when you release the button.  Now, place the blade over the pin and rotate 90 degrees into place.  The pin should retract.  To remove the blade, push the black button, rotate the blade out of operating position (90 degrees) and slide it off the pin.  It is now in position to install the next blade.Hope this is useful! 	hyerin94	10-24-2015 23:02:04	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

33609556	I am remodeling a house, and needed a tool to cut through grout and wood.  Maybe they include really cheap blades with the kit, but I was really disappointed in the performance.  I needed to cut through a thick line of grout at a door--it took forever and totally dulled the blade.  I next used the wood cutting blades to try to neatly cut oak flooring I was removing where the floor went under cabinets.  The blade burned and smoked and dulled and I gave up.  I've ordered a dewalt angle grinder/cutting saw that I should have gotten in the first place.Update:  A month later and while cutting flooring nails off reclaimed oak floors three of the little nodules on the OIS accessory holder popped off.  I don't know the minimum amount required to hold an accessory on the tool, but I am probably close.  These are not particularly thick nails--they are the kind that are used in pneumatic floor nailers.  I really should send it back, but I found a place online (toolpartspro.com) that has the replacement part for less than $7.  I'm hoping I can replace it easily myself, but I'd buy another brand if I had it to do all over again. 	hyerin94	10-24-2015 23:07:00	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
60146492	I bought my combo from Ace Hardware after doing research on this certain compressor on other websites. For some reason, Amazon customers are getting bad units or something but I have had mine since Jan 2013 and used it probably weekly since I have purchased it on all kinds of different projects and I have never had a problem. I have used the nailer that it came with and also another name brand nailer and both have functioned flawlessly. I am very happy with my purchase and for the money and portability, I don't think that you could beat this deal. Don't let all the bad reviews steer you away from this product.

26307957	Having gone through 2 Dustbusters prior to buying this unit, I am very happy with it. The filter is easy to access and clean, it is well balanced, has a large capacity for dirt, a replaceable battery that is interchangeable with my other tools, and the hose is a very nice feature. Many others have said that the unit is as loud as a full size Shop vac, but I found it to be less than that and tolerable for the 30-60 seconds that it is typically used for.The one significant shortcoming for me is the lack of a mounting bracket to let me hang it on a cabinet door. Overall I highly recommend it. Oh, and did I mention it has a replaceable battery? 	hyerin94	10-24-2015 23:15:52	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

53909635	The tool does what is supposed to; although I do think it runs down the battery faster than a drill or impact driver does.It comes with ONE Bi-Medal Blade; A battery (18V not XC), the charger, and a sturdy carrying bag, not plastic case.  Of course, an instruction manual for both the battery and tool are included.It's okay, but I bought this kit because of the free battery Milwaukee was giving away at the time.  I already own a charger, so another battery would've been nice, instead of another charger.It's just okay for the money.  Like I said, the bag IS nice and sturdy.  It does not look cheap by any means.The tool performs superb!  I had to cut some cast iron ground electrical outlets which are ever so outdated, but it's all we could find where I live.  Had to cut around 16 of these in close quarters.  This tool saved me days of work and pounds of fat I would've lost having to cut with a manual hacksaw; due to the close quarters cut, this tool saved the day.Well worth the money.  I highly recommend it.  Like all purchases of Milwaukee products, although expensive, I haven't regreted buying a single one and the 5 year guarantee comes in very handy.This tool requires 6 month interval regular maintenance at authorized service centers. 	hyerin94	10-24-2015 23:17:58	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

Just remember its oilless, don't even think about reaching for that bottle of oil!

57215776	This thing is worth its weight, no question.  Had an old Sears, (so old thery were using polished aluminum housings), but even considering it's age, it was crude by comparison.  The Dewalt feels like it's on auto-pilot until you want to make a turn and off it goes...very little effort is required or recommended.  The blade mounting mechanism is likewise a dream.  Maybe a factor of the blade itself but the mounting mechanism keeps the blade straight and ridid.  Shaving the edge off a bad cut is like slicing off a paper thin piece of ham with a really sharp knife.  Blade changes are a snap and tooless.  Also love that adjustable jet of air on the cut to help reveal the line.  If you are in the market for a good jig saw, please do not hesitate to take a close look at this tool. 	hyerin94	10-24-2015 23:39:50	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

43156295	It would be easy to abuse this tool by asking it to do more than that for which it was designed.  But it is well designed for relatively light jobs.

It is also great for working where I have to reach far away from my body  where a normal size drill would be difficult to hold steady.

55811912	As a proffesional contractor who relies on my tools to feed my family I have to say this tool is a winner.  I was introduced to it by a finish carpenter who had been using one he got as a gift.  It has almost replaced my regular heavy 18v drill.  the hex bits work great, but beware of breaking them easily.  Also the hex drill bits can not be resharpened easily.  Between this tool and the Dewalt 7.2v screwdriver, I have gone from using my big 18v drill daily to less than weekly.  I love this tool for setting and removing tapcon screws in concrete!!! nothing is better!!  I also discovered that by placing a soft brass rotarly brush in it, it is a wonderful tool to cleen off wood, concrete, and sidding.  I used to have my assistant clean the concrete splatters off of sidding until I discovered this.  Now instead of taking the better part of a hour to clean a porch, it is done in less than 10 minutes and usually less than 5.  Time is money and this tool saves time in a big way.  The only major downside is the cost of hex accesories and the quality of them.  You will definitely get what you pay for in them, so don't scrimp and buy the cheapies.  Especially screwdriver bits, they break too easy and you'll just end up going through them faster.  I highly recomend using square drive screws with this tool. 	hyerin94	10-24-2015 23:52:37	No Defect		Expert	No		false

The new charger was smoking and when I unplugged and took the unit outside to examine it.  The charger's plastic was bubbled, blistered and smoking hot. I am so lucky I didn't plug this in and leave my house-- I might not have a house if I did.

27946082	I've been using this for a few months now doing trim work on a small modular cabin. It doesn't get much easier than this. The compressor is virtually maintenance free and the only adjustments necessary are the regulator pressure on the compressor and the nail depth on the gun, both of which are no-brainers.I had never used a pneumatic nailer before but I was up and running in about 10 minutes. That included reading the manual. I ran a few nails into a couple pieces of scrap to check/adjust nail depth and went to work.When not in use, the hose can be wound up and placed in the included tool bag with the gun and put away neatly.The one thing to be aware of is that the compressor motor is loud. Some might consider that a con but it doesn't matter to me. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 12:30:07	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
38130427	I am a novice DIYer.  I have been using this drill for about a month now and it works great.  Small, compact, and I spend the afternoon driving screws with it and did not have to recharge it even after a few hours.  I don't have a lot to compare it to, but it is certainly a lot better than my previous bulky Kawasaki drill.  I suspect the difference is the Lithium battery. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 12:30:07	No Defect		Novice	No		true

55711042	Really happy with these. I agonized over whether to get the impact driver as well, or just the drill, but I'm glad I did. It's made quick work of a number of jobs, and the tools feel very good - solid and nicely made.One of the batteries I received had a broken clip, but this was pretty smoothly sorted out by the vendor. The units have 'Reconditioned' stickers on the handle that can't be easily removed (you can remove the sticker, but it leaves behind a mark).  I think Bosch doesn't want these being passed of as new, basically. But they're tools, so a mark is no big deal. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 12:31:12	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
57230030	You are living in the dark ages if you are not using an impact driver for sinking all screws.  We finished building the concrete forms for a shop  house using 3 galvanized deck screws.  The 18v impact driver can sink 4 screws in the time it takes the 18v drill to sink 1.  We are also using 6 timberlock screws on this project and it is amazing how fast the impact driver can run them in.  Buy an impact driver - your clients will thank you for the reduced billing time on all of your jobs. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 12:31:12	No Defect		Expert	No		true
26782029	I have only used this for several door trim installations so far but I like it. It is light and easy to handle, the lack of a swiveling air fitting did not cause any problems. No jams so far, ( I was using Hitachi branded nails which may have helped, I don't know yet) but one of the reasons I chose it was the flip-open nose piece in case there ever as a jam, to make it easier to clear.I havea number of other Hitachi products, corded and cordless, and I like them all. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 12:31:12	No Defect		Expert	No		true

33045710	First things said, I am a contractor so I did use this tool somewhat, not every day but maybe once a week on average for 6-8 months. The blade change is great and the tool itself works pretty good. At issue is the battery, I went through 2 batteries and had them replaced under warranty and then the replaced batteries also died. Maybe the fact that they can be vibrated loose may have some bearing on why they fail so quickly. I would guess each battery's life was maybe a total of 4-5 actual working hours. The problem, its $50 to replace each battery on a $94 tool. Porter-Cable used to make great tools and I own many different types of their tools, but this one is a deadbeat. Buy a corded version or a different brand of cordless. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 12:34:04	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		true

26019988	True I am addicted to Harbor Freight, but that's because if you know what you are checking out, their tools are quality. I had just bought a Porter Cable 2 in 1 nailer and when I saw the CP version in HF for half the price, I decided to try it. I built my friend's daughter's room when their baby was on it way - no problems. So I figured what the hell...worst thing is I have to return it. I bought this guy to help me repair/replace portions of a deteriorating front porch...hell, I not only replaced some of the floor planks but I redesigned and built a sturdier (more up to code) railing all around. My neighbors compliment on my work even though it was my first solo full rail. It worked beautifully. It is true as with some of the other CP nailers that the design is slightly bigger, sometimes it can spark and perhaps a tad heavier...but i think for the deep price difference, it is a minor issue at that. #1 - it nailed fine at an angle as long as you have the point as flushed as possible and slightly more umph #2 sparks are only from the nail fills that are held by a thin metal wire and lacquer - otherwise, the only lacquer held is fine #3 build some muscle...it ain't that much heaver for christ's sake. It's metal housing and rubber insert grips with a non-marring nylon front.PRO:- pretty decent build quality- back vent that rotated so you don't shoot air in your face and fall off the roof or something- loading slide is easy, has a lever to keep unused nail from just dropping out when your finished...slide down and push in a lever  and a shake will slide it out.- price- comes with an allen wrench, oil, manual and tethered cap to keep inlet dirt free- safety feature as all should need to push the front tip on surface to enable the trigger to engage and fireCons:- body is slightly wider than few on the market but not a deal breaker. I've seen other major brand with bodies just as wide or awkward-  after some usage..check the nail reservoir screws as the vibrations after all that usage may loosen it. Simple fix, I dabbed a tiny smear of blue locktite but it took repairing a medium sized front porch, side deck and other misc repairs for them to finally vibrate loose so this is a very nit picky point- non-marring tip can be slippery at angle shots but not a stick point either. I did see some nailer with a knurled tip for grip..maybe an upgrade for this if I can fine one but if you really need to I'm sure you can figure something - again - nit pick- perhaps it's only with HF nails, don't wait until the very last nail in reserve, it can jam. I usually keep a healthy reserve and it's smooth nailing all the way. No biggie.IMHO - my cons were a nit pick list. I really have no complaints so far and I've been rocking away all sorts of projects. Easy maintenance - just one drop of oil in the inlet before airing up. Otherwise, air puff the outside and a quick wipe. One of the best 60 bucks I saved...I obviously returned the porter cable since. Oh yea, if you buy from Harbor freight, don't forget your coupon and it'll be cheaper plus whatever freebie is for that month! 	rgruss	10-25-2015 12:35:47	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

35877241	I had this saw for years now. Its heavy but then again, once you see the metal case you should not expect any less. The unit purrs as it makes short work of nails, ply, studs, metal pipe, roots, pvc, fencing, posts ... yeah, your fingers if you're not careful.I love the power, the control switch, variable speed and orbital blade control.  Its all about control and calculation at work, safety.Changing the blade is easy even when hot thanks to the rubber cover.  The handle is nice and the rubber part on the front makes it for a natural grip.  Its a comfortable tool as long as its used properly as it is powerful as well as heavy.If you're a homeowner, it will probably be a little much but if you're starting to get into the trades or are in the trades, we all know Milwaukee has legendary sawalls but I would say the JR3070 gives you a lot more for the buck with a cool look to add to the mix.

53909635	The tool does what is supposed to; although I do think it runs down the battery faster than a drill or impact driver does.It comes with ONE Bi-Medal Blade; A battery (18V not XC), the charger, and a sturdy carrying bag, not plastic case.  Of course, an instruction manual for both the battery and tool are included.It's okay, but I bought this kit because of the free battery Milwaukee was giving away at the time.  I already own a charger, so another battery would've been nice, instead of another charger.It's just okay for the money.  Like I said, the bag IS nice and sturdy.  It does not look cheap by any means.The tool performs superb!  I had to cut some cast iron ground electrical outlets which are ever so outdated, but it's all we could find where I live.  Had to cut around 16 of these in close quarters.  This tool saved me days of work and pounds of fat I would've lost having to cut with a manual hacksaw; due to the close quarters cut, this tool saved the day.Well worth the money.

At the same time I ended up buying the 7-piece compact set.  The tools in that are slightly lower quality but again, very high.  No issues with them.

29840786	Since I think most folks would consider this a major purchase decision for  their shop, I opted to write this review only after I had a chance to  really give it a workout.  I have been using this saw in my shop for about  8 months and must say I have been extremely satisfied with its performance.  I haven't needed to make any adjustments since the intial setup except for  the table saw insert:  small table vibration will change the screw heights  so I recommend you put a drop of epoxy down to hold each of the alan screws  in place.Assembly went fairly well with one hitch.  There are seven  bolts to mount for attaching the front guide rail that holds the rip fence.  Only 6 of the 7 holes aligned correctly, so I have to admit I was cussing  and swearing a bit when the 7th bolt wouldn't go in.  I had to drill and  tap a new hole (6 bolts are probably enough but I was determined to get  that 7th one in), so I was mildly disappointed that Jet's manufacturing  quality let that type of defect slip through.Things I really like:  the  handwheels are big, have a nice feel, and they have very little backplay.  The lock down knobs that hold the saw's height and angle are real secure.  Teflon glides are mounted on the side of the ripfence which gives you a  nice smooth action.  The fence also sits very low on the table - I have no  problem ripping 1/8quot; plywood.  Except for the inductive kick when you  start the motor, its otherwise pretty quiet.  Table vibration is really  minimal, even though I have the saw mounted on a mobile base.Quality  of cutting is superb.  I use thin kerf blades and have cut just about  everything from 1/8quot; ply to 12/4quot; cherry and yes, it cuts like  the proverbial hot knife thru butter.  There is ample power to keep the  blade rpm consistent even through the thick hardwoods - something my 110V  saw could never do.Things that I think could be improved:  though its  fine when locked in place, the rip fence is cumbersome to move especially  when you are making minor adjustments.  I'll rationalize my comment as a  price trade-off.  That's primarily because the fence slides on only the  front guide rail.  The teflon/plastic screw inserts they use to adjust the  heighth and squaring of the fence are a bit tacky - they are hard to turn  and should be made better.  I also think the blade guard can be improved:  to remove it you have to loosen a bolt that's underneath the table insert.  I don't like that because first you have to pull the insert, and second you  have to put a wrench and your hand nearer to the blade - I think there are  good designs out there where the blade guard can be bolted and unbolted  entirely from the outside of the cabinet.  Finally, I'll note that the  primary table top has a bevelled front edge, but the extensions wings do  not.  I can't figure out why they didn't bevel the extensions wings as  well, because you end up with two sharp corners on the front edge of the  table where the extensions wing get mounted.  I ended up filing those  corners down so that there was no possibility of scraping my hands or  potentially marring any wood surface.All totalled, the saw still gets my  5 rating with the comments noted above.  I researched and compared this saw  to several other manufacturers that I concluded cost several hundred  dollars more for the same level of quality and performance.  I also  recommend buying a left tilt saw - I think it's safer because the saw teeth  tilt away from you when doing angled cuts and you're less likely to bind or  kick back the work piece. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 12:42:36	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

24626844	I bought this track saw unit on Amazon through CPO Dewalt.  I was very pleased with the speed and thoroughness of the transaction and the quick delivery.Pros: Soft start, variable speed settings dial on motor housing, smooth vertical plunge, adjustable riving knife.  This track saw can split hairs when it comes to cutting on the line.  Excellent one man operation for cutting sheet goods.  Excellent cut with sharp blade.Cons:Limited blade selection and availability - this may change in the future.Light silicon spray lubricant on track actually improves performance.If you don't use dust collection, the dust port is aimed straight down and to the rear.  This will leave a lot of dust and debris on the track and will interfere with saw movement, especially if you want to move the saw backwards (anti-kickback off).  Must clean/dust off the track everytime.Eccentric cam-style front and rear plastic track saw guides - the guides are used to remove lateral play from the saw and the track, and then screwed down to fix their position.  I haven't had any problems yet with the screws coming loose from vibration or knocking the guides out of place, but these two little pieces of plastic (track saw guides) rub against the aluminum track and will eventually wear down.You can't cut the anti-splinter strip completely from end to end on the track.  If you line up one end of the track with the rear of the base shoe of the saw, you end up being 3 inches short from the end during the plunge.  You can cut the anti-splinter strip completely, if you connect another section of track and just follow through.The blade change procedure is a little tricky.  You have to assist the plunge trigger by pressing it slightly backward at the same time that you are depressing the lock button.The 102 track is one long piece of aluminum and it is difficlt to transport (it doesn't fit in the bed of my pickup, so I strap it to my overhead rack), but necessary for ripping the long side of sheet goods.Don't bother getting the right angle or miter accessories, they are useless.  The arms on the right angle and miter accessory are just too short to be effective.  Just mark the line, align the track, plunge, and cut.  You only need the clamps.When the bevel angle of the saw is set at 45 degrees, it feels like the center of gravity of the saw goes past the track and the weight of the saw feels like the saw will tip over and disengage the track.  The saw will cut on the line perfectly, but use two hands to support the saw and clamp the track down...for your safety.Overall, I would recommended this product, especially if you are a one man show and deal with a lot of sheet goods.  It's easy to setup and get started, with a few quirks mentioned above. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 12:42:36	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
31291587	Bought this sander 1 year ago to back up my Porter-Cable 352vs (I have since grown so tired of repairing the Porter-Cable that the last time it needed repair I just threw it away).  It runs so quietly for a belt sander that the first time I used it I thought the speed control was set on low (it was on high). It's well balanced, has plenty of power, and the dust bag actually collects a lot of dust, a huge plus when I have to scribe cabinets inside a customers house.  Also, the shape of the sander makes it easy to clamp to a workbench for sanding small items, an impossibility with the Porter-Cable. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 15:35:35	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

This is easier than adjusting the air pressure to control the depth of the nail driven.One issue I have had relates to the silicone boot that slips over the nailing base foot.  It slips off too easily when I am driving at an angle. I have had it fall off the gun while on scaffolding, requiring a time-consuming trip up and down.  Using the base foot without the boot has caused marks on the redwood that is being installed. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 15:35:35	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
59727654	I don't think they make this model, anymore. Mine says made in Switzerland on it. It's been over 6 years, later, and this saw is great. The blade ejects and inserts, easily. It cuts beautifully, with almost no vibration.Bosch jigsaw blades are fantastic. With the right blade, this saw will crosscut maple and leave a shiny smooth finish that looks like it's been sanded an polished. Too bad it's so hard to cut a perfectly straight edge with a jigsaw.My saw tends to cut a bit off line. I know most jigsaws do. I wish there were a way to adjust the blade/shoe orientation on a jigsaw to allow for correction. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 15:37:04	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

55424656	First of, I have always used DeWalt drills since I was a kid, because my dad did, and every place I have worked (construction related) has used DeWalt, so I am very partial to DeWalt power tools. I am a Junior in architecture school, and I use this drill all the time for model making and an assortment of other random things. It out powers a lot of my classmates, Ryobi, Black and Decker and Makita drills. I've always found DeWalt drills, and their power tools in general to be very powerful, I've only had one fail on me at work, and the engine failed on it while mixing concrete(which puts a lot of stress on the motor), it was already 5 years old, so it had actually lasted quite a while for it's function and the amount of stress that was put on it. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 15:40:26	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
36717991	I currently have several comparable electric screw drivers I keep around the house. But this one added some new features that none of the other screw drivers had, so I decided to add this one to the collection to see how well it did. So far, it has worked quite well.As far as power, this is your standard BD; 3.6V rechargable screw driver and is about on par with the competition. For light duties around the house, it'll do just fine. Just keep in mind these aren't drills or high powered screw drivers. If you find that it runs out of power, you probably need a more powerful unit.The light works. But just barely. It's not very bright, but does help out in certain situations. It will also dim if the screw driver starts to have to work harder than usual. It also features a swivel adjustment so it can be used as a normal straight screw driver or at an angle as pictured. However, since it is rather bulky in either configuration, I normally just kept it in the angle position.It's very easy to grip and hold on to thanks to the rubber moldings at key locations. It's also light weight and even has a place for 1 extra bit. Battery life, also right about average for other BD; 3.6v screw drivers. Just charge it up over night and it'll last quite awhile. Li-Ion would be nice, but that would also cost a lot more. For basic use around the house, fast charge times and super long life aren't a priority. At least not with this model!One important feature that's missing is a torque setting. This prevents me from using it with more sensitive electronics where even 3.6V can be too much. But at this price point, I guess you can't expect too much!Pros:* Built-in Light* 2 Angle Adjustement* Descent battery life* Rechargable battery* Powerful enough for most jobs around the houseCons:* No Torque Setting* Somewhat bulkyOverall considering it's price and features, I would recommend this screw driver. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 15:40:26	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
49228348	Today I had a few small projects to do and set out to use vices and hand files. Three hours later I barely made a dent. Dropped everything, went to Home Depot. Bought a Dremel 300 with a 2 year extended warranty, and a few extra pieces. *Should of bought a green grind stone, but there was no hardness rating listed on the packaging.Went home, read the instructions, and proceeded with my project. Was changing an awl bit from a Leatherman Super Tool 300 over to fit a Leatherman Charge, so my Charge would have an awl too.Most of the folks over at MultiTool.org have machine shops and lots of room to work with. Myself I live in a trailer new and not much room, and no machine shop - until now.The supplied grind wheel took ground down the bit, using the other as a stencil while clamped together using a Leatherman Crunch (vice grips). Swapped out for a sander bit to smooth out the bumps and finalize the fitting. Sanded down the surface with 400 grit sandpaper and used the Dremel 300's polishing wheel and compound before final fitting.Was done in 30 minutes where it would of taken me days using hand files. Then took out a Sawsall, matched it up with a removable lanyard ring, clamped that together with the Crunch. Used the Dremel 300 fiberglass wheel to cut and fine grind the grooves and tabs. Removed the stencil, used the fiberglass wheel on low speed to finish the grooves and tabs, and fitted the saw. Took a whole five minutes to complete this second project.Now have a portable saw that attaches to my new Leatherman Charge TTi.Should of gotten a Dremel 300 earlier, would of been done and on to other projects. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 15:40:26	No Defect		Expert	No		true
45641364	This tool was great at first.  Unfortunately, the battery gradually stops holding a charge, and becomes too weak to be used for even a few minutes.  The battery on my unit also began leaking and it corroded the connections in the motor section just after the warranty expired.  I would recommend buying a more powerful and better made dremel, even if you intend to use it for dog nail trimming, with the hope that it will last longer.While it still worked, I found it very useful, and my dog liked it better than the nail clippers.  It was also easier to trim dark colored nails without cutting the nail's quick. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 15:42:44	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
57156594	I am a professional guitar repairman who has been constantly stringing guitars for over 35 years. Due to hand/wrist issues, winding strings manually just isn't in the cards for me anymore, and although using a manual peg winder (crank) is faster and easier than winding by hand, it's still hard on my wrists and is still too slow.Over the last several months I have been using a few different Power Screwdrivers with a peg adaptor that's designed to fit guitar tuner knobs. Unfortunately, virtually EVERY rechargeable screwdrivers on the market only has a motor speed of around 200RPM. This is way too slow for me.  Okay, I know what you're thinking... Just use a f----n' cordless drill with the peg adaptor. Yeah, that'd definitely be faster... WAY TOO FAST and TOO HEAVY! A cordless drill is capable of spinning so fast that you could easily over-wind and break strings before you know it. Cordless drills are also too bulky to have around delicate guitars and would also be in the way on my bench. My customers would freak if I took a big drill to their priceless axe.The answer; The Ryobi TEK4 Power Screwdriver. It's small, clutched, rechargeable, and allows you to crank at 600 RPMs. Naturally, it accepts all hex bits and if you want to use it as a drill, it accepts drill bits with hex shanks. I even bought a keyed chuck that has a hex shank that fits the Ryobi so I can use normal drill bits if I need to. You can also kick the Ryobi down to 200rpms if need be. There's a switch on the top for 200 or 600 rpm speed. The 200 rpm motor speed has  more torque than the 600rpm speed.At 600 rpms, the Tek4 cranks strings FAST, but not too fast as to break them or lose control of your neat wind around the tuner's post. IT'S THE PERFECT SPEED! As a bonus, the TEK4 has allowed me to eliminate my big cordless drill entirely from ever making an appearance on my bench.  I purchased an extra TEK4 battery so one is always charging overnight and is ready for a long day of string winding.I only have 3 slightly non-positive things to say;First, the forward/reverse button tends to get hit easily just by laying the unit on it's side.  When it's not pushed all the way in to either forward or reverse, the motor doesn't turn at all until you correct it. The switch needs to be relocated and it needs a more positive click so it doesn't accidentally move into neutral.Secondly, my trigger button has stuck ON a few times. Let's hope this was just a fluke. I'd truly hate to have to go throw it at the CEO of Ryobi so hard as to put him in a comaLastly, I am worried Ryobi will one day ditch the entire TEK4 4V line, and these batteries will not be easy to substitute.Other than that, I HIGHLY recommend this as a pro-grade string winder.UPDATE; 8/27/13- The Ryobi Tec 4V is still in daily service on my busy guitar bench. The forward/reverse button is a little bit worse (looser) than described above, but it's still not bad enough to call it broken. The driver is definitely getting bench worn, but I keep it clean and blow out the dirt once a week or so. I'm considering getting a second one before they aren't available anymore. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 15:42:44	No Defect		Expert	No		false

51218077	I already have a blue 5 piece Ryobi 18v tool set (drill, reciprocating saw, circular saw, flashlight, small vacuum) that I got several years ago.  It has been a good set but the original 1.7 Ah Ni-cad batteries now have very limited life and a very short shelf life.  I have been looking for new batteries and started watching ebay to see if there were any deals.  The Li-ion is definitely a better value and a better pack, but I don't think they are worth what is being charged for them.  (I work for a major cell phone manufacturer and we purchase millions of Li-ion cells to make phone batteries so I have some idea of what these actually cost.)So I have been looking for a better deal when I stumbled on this set on Amazon (I buy lots of stuff from Amazon every year A+++).I read the reviews and did some research, looked at the pictures, and figured it would be worth the $[...] they were asking (although the price dropped to $[...] in the two days since I ordered it) to get the new charger and the two larger battery packs and placed my order Sunday night.  Wednesday I receive my package (Amazon Prime A+++) and opened it up.  I am very disappointed.  :(The kit arrived with two used P103 cells.  These are the small/short Li-ion packs and not the P104 high capacity packs that are shown in the pictures on Amazon and the CPORyobi.com website.  These are not much better than new Ni-cads IMHO AND they are obviously used.  One has a guys name written on the bottom!  Batteries have a limited number of recharge cycles in their life.  Typically a Li-ion cell (as used in a laptop or cell phone) is good for 1.5 to 2 years.  While it may seem OK now and for the next 6-12 months, how do I know that they have not seen considerable use already?We take used phones or field returns, fix any issues, update the software, and replace any parts that show obvious wear so they are like new.  This is what Factory Reconditioned is supposed to mean.  THEN we send them back out to people/carriers as warranty replacements.  It is very poor business practice of Ryobi to ship out items with such obvious wear and tear on them and call them reconditioned and Like New.  They should call them what they are... Used Tools that have been checked at the factory to see if they work.  These are definitly not Like New as advertised.The drill looks to be in pretty good condition (although it does show some use marks) and the flashlight is also in good condition (and very bright).  The batteries and charger are beat up a bit and things were crudely hot stamped with RECON on them which definitely detracts from the like new condition.  Overall if you were willing to pay the exorbitant price for one of these sets new this may be a good value for you.Since I was really only looking for the two P104 batteries and the charger, (figured I'd sell the obnoxious green drill and flashlight for $[...] on Fleabay to recoup some of my cost) and what was shipped were the lower capacity P103 packs and not the higher 2.4Ah capacity P104 packs that were shown in the pictures, I will be returning it.  I can pick up two NEW P104 packs and a New charger for $[...] more than I paid Amazon right now if I wanted to spend that much... Two stars and I am going to try and post some pics...- followup on 4/01/09 - I was able to purchase this same reconditioned P813 kit from another website for five bones less (delivered) and it DID include two of the P104 batteries as shown in the Amazon pictures.

41786783	The lights on this grinder are better than those I've seen at home improvement stores. It arrived in a timely manner and works well. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that if you are grinding something with a handle, such as a hatchet, the design of double grinding stones makes it hard to grind both sides of the hatchet. The reason? The handle can't move because of the proximity of the second stone. Anything with a handle longer than the distance between the two stones isn't going to work well. Otherwise, a great product. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 15:51:19	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
29236755	This tool is adequate, but no more. The batteries don't last as long as they might. They are very small and are not 12 volt. The 12-Volt Max is an advertising exaggeration based upon the maximum voltage one could get out of them if fully charged and the tool was loaded to the point of stalling, I suppose. Sometimes the drive skips a little before it takes hold and goes to work. It does drive 4 screws, and the tool size is handy. I like the impact action. It doesn't twist due to torque, which makes it safer to use where I don't want to damage a cabinet. I am a cabinetmaker. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 15:51:19	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		true

55370740	I got this grinder at Lowe's because they were cheaper. I only got it because of the lower speed to sharpen lathe tools . It ran fine for about 10 min. on the slower speed then suddenly it started running at top speed. The speed control had no effect on it. I felt of the motor and it was so hot you couldn't leave your hand on it. I turned it off and waited till it cooled down and turned it back on. It only had the top speed . So I guess I just got a Lemon. I returned it to Lowes for a refund. Good luck if you buy this model. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 15:51:35	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

31335102	Bought over a year ago to cut pinewood derby cars, and other misc projects in the shop.  Product came with broken switch on work light, fortunately it's stuck 'ON' so I know when it's plugged in.Getting the smaller woodworking blades to cut straight is difficult.  Have to closely monitor the spacing of the upper AND lower guides.  Larger metal type blades were much easier to manage.Not a heavy duty machine for all day cutting.  Exhaust system does not clean out the fine saw dust, even with a powerful shop-vac attached.It's fine for occasional, light work.

37392880	My boyfriend had this set and I was helping him work on our bicycles to tighten gears, etc. I fell in love with the ease of use that this set provides.Boyfriend left his tool set on the boat, and out in the rain, gradually lost the screwdriver bits, and the tools became rusty and icky. Still totally functional though. (minus the bits gone AWOL).Now i am a girly girl, but I'm also pretty handy. So I decided I wanted the same tool set of my own, for when boyfriend and I move in together. I didn't trust him not to lose or #34;mistreat#34; a new set so I'm keeping it for my own. We both love using the screwdriver and wrench for around-the-house projects. Haven't really had a use for the socket wrench yet, but when I used it on the bikes that day, it made the job so much easier, and even fun! 	winp0007	10-25-2015 15:52:45	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

53117770	This impact driver  drill set was recommended to me by a professional cabinet maker.  It is simply great; light, compact, powerful, quick charging, it even has an led light to help see in tight places.  The only problem is perhaps it is too powerful.  But this is probably my technique.  I need to learn there is no pre-set clutch but the clutch is controlled by the trigger.

42836692	Even before I put this in a drill I could tell there would be some trouble and I would have to be careful with it.  There is a property of gear mesh called wink, and this 90 degree drive design allows it to vary.  When you put any pressure on the shaft which chucks into the drill, it causes the gears to mesh together and jam.  When you pull back on the shaft, it pulls the gears too far apart, which will cause the stress to all be on the outermost part of the teeth and cause premature wear.  If they had spent one more dollar putting in a thrust plate and washer, it would have kept the gear spacing, or wink, constant, which would have been ideal.That said, this does the job, you just have to be careful not to push the power drill hard into the tool when you use it.  I usually give tools that just barely do the job only three stars (I buy and rate a lot of tools at Amazon), but because this is the smallest profile 90 degree drill adapter I have ever used or even seen, I am giving it an extra star for that.This, in combination with the stubby drill bits I also purchased, allows me to drill in the smaller spaces than any other 90 degree drill tool I have, and I have several.The magnetic hex base allows the use of both snap lock hex drill bits and the small hex multi-tool screwdriver bits as well.  It is not a snap-lock tool, it depends on a magnet at the bottom of the hex shaped hole to hold the bits in place.  This does cause the bits to stick further out of the tool than a true snap lock check would, but that is part of the tradeoff for the small profile of the tool.The drill bit supplied with mine is out of true, meaning the tip makes a circle when you spin it.  Its the same effect as if the bit was bent.  Its worthless and I've thrown it away, but it wasn't much of a feature anyway.  I didn't buy the tool for the drill bit that came with it.Overall, I like it because it fits in tight places, but I do wish they had spent the extra little bit to hold the drive shaft in place and thus had constant gear wink, had that been done I would have called it excellent and given it five stars.  Unfortunately, adding a thrust plate and washer is not a modification you can easily retrofit in a home workshop, it has to be designed into the tool.  For that reason, I expect to have to replace it a few years, maybe by then they will have a new model that doesn't have this one defect. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 15:52:45	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

33623235	To save reading/typing, I'll echo what M/M Larsen, Martin, and Takahashi all said. I bought mine for the exact reason of M. Larsen....Additionally, I was in the water intrusion forensics in the mid-90s and saw someone use it on stucco to line out where to break out the stucco. They had multiple batteries and back then, the saw was a wonder.People have to remember that in the early-mid-90s, 9.6v was state of the art. The saw seems so under powered now, but back then, it was one of the first of its kind. Makita does make a 14.4v unit.Longevity: I used mine on site over several years and 40 water intrusion forensic jobs...inside and outside (mostly for drywall, though), and I have the original one I bought in 1996. I bought a little tool box for it and have been soooooo happy.I retro-fitted the masonry water-drip kit and have cut tile, flagstone, brick, maybe thin concrete, and most recently....a granite countertop--all counter to opinion I heard today from a Home Depot whiz. Where other saws don't fit, this one does (heads in, not the long tail-end) with much less chance of overcutting--kind of important on one-time-get-it-right cuts.It isn't good for plunge cutting (not a surprise---other saws are designed for that), and the batteries don't last long if you're doing heavy cutting. But for small, fine cuts...Foot stomp: like the others said... get a carbide blade. Oh, charge the battery before using it out of the box. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 15:53:35	No Defect		Expert	No		true
39962424	I've had this blower running in my shop for over 2 years. It was used daily and for several hours on average. Granted, I didn't actually use it for shop dust, as I was only sucking out fumes from some laser cutters I had. It definitely did the job and ran with no problems.I eventually switched to another 650CFM blower I found on Amazon. The other one was just a stand alone blower that you can attach a bag to. I hooked up the exhaust end to blow it directly out of the building instead this time around and that blower was a little quieter than this one. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 15:53:35	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

I also bought a grinder from Ace to fit on it so I can sharpen my garden tools with it.  I use mine a lot, but to be honest I have not tried to put 3 screws in hardwood.

22137108	That's kind of the essence of the tool. Mine arrived warped, with a 1/8 deep dish across the center, perpendicular to the saw blade, all the way to the back. Simply stated, the table is warped and  not flat. The blade may be in perfect vertical alignment on the leading edge relative to the one side, but it can't be aligned on both sides simultaneously. And since the table changes its angle from front to back as the work is fed through, it cant be aligned on both the front and back of the table, and you will never get a clean or accurate cut.I ain't never seen such a thing. Problem is I bought it three months ago it for a planned job this weekend, and only discovered the flaw when checking the alignment last night. Which means I  can't use it if I want to return it, and I get to pay the freight on the return.If you order, open on arrival and go over every alignment point immediately. Next time, I'll buy local. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 15:55:13	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
54264581	An excellent tool for installing hardwood flooring, especially a sand in place floor.  I suggest getting the wider softer shoe kit for laminates and engineered hardwoods to prevent scratches in the finish.  I am 2000 square feet into this nailer with no jams, but I use cleats from Primatech out of Canada, the glue holding the clips together is stronger and more flexible than the PortaNails cleats,  they stay in one strand rather than breaking up, making loading much quicker. Being a general contractor and not a flooring contractor means my nailer will only see occasional use rather than e everyday, I believe this to be the perfect balance between cost and quality! 	rgruss	10-25-2015 15:55:13	No Defect		Expert	No		true

24478541	I've got a set of Milwaukee v28/m28s for heavy duty ranch work; I bought them when that range first came out and they have seen heavy use for many years. They are my main point of comparison with these LXT18s from Makita.I bought these Makitas for the extraordinary range of tool types that Makita offers, but I also believed the hype that 18v lithiums had improved to the point that they can compete with 28s on power and stamina.In a word: They can'tThese are good tools, but they lack the brutal power and amazing stamina of the (bigger and heavier) Milwaukees. The hammer drill won't beat at concrete for as long, the sawzall won't rip through thick steel pipe as quickly and the skillsaw runs out of juice much quicker. I'm also disappointed with the keyless chuck on the makita sawzall: unnecessarily hard to change blades, compared with the great system on the Milwaukee.For what it's worth, I've heard rumors that the Milwaukees have declined in quality since they moved their operation overseas, so my comparison could well be out of date.The upside of the Makitas is that they are very well made (no plastic clutches here!) and there are a lot of tools for different needs. I just wish they would work on the battery stamina. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 15:56:43	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
35877241	I had this saw for years now. Its heavy but then again, once you see the metal case you should not expect any less. The unit purrs as it makes short work of nails, ply, studs, metal pipe, roots, pvc, fencing, posts ... yeah, your fingers if you're not careful.I love the power, the control switch, variable speed and orbital blade control.  Its all about control and calculation at work, safety.Changing the blade is easy even when hot thanks to the rubber cover.  The handle is nice and the rubber part on the front makes it for a natural grip.  Its a comfortable tool as long as its used properly as it is powerful as well as heavy.If you're a homeowner, it will probably be a little much but if you're starting to get into the trades or are in the trades, we all know Milwaukee has legendary sawalls but I would say the JR3070 gives you a lot more for the buck with a cool look to add to the mix.  Get some lenox blades and you'll be bringing the thunder to the jobsite, friends.  Good times. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 15:56:43	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

54730556	Being a user of Delta amp; Porter Cable products and builder of cabinets and fine furniture, once again, Delta's reputation of quality machinery stands true.

32192280	Smooth running machine w/ tight fit and feel.  Quality components.  Dust collection needs improving.  No option given for dust bag.  Cast miter scale gets covered w/ sawdust as does magnified pointer (Keep an air nozzle handy!)  I ended up using a Sharpie to make some of the angles more visible. Dust gets into bevel lock down causing saw head to slide down to 45' bevel, even during a cut. Customizable miter stop feature allows for one stop only...not very helpful when doing crown, base or other cuts where you need a corresponding angle.  Fence extensions do not slide far enough out of the way and must be disassembled to reach certain compound angles.  Miter lock handle quickly became loose and fell off.  Trigger safety button would be nice.  Quality laser would be nice.  I've owned this saw for about a year and still can't get used to it.  I find myself going back to my nine-year-old Makita LS 1211.

24515488	If you're the kind of DIY person on a regular basis then you should get this one! I went to L****'s because I could not wait for delivery. The chipping bit is light and strong. None of the so called self help websites from TV ever mentioned that a 40 year old house bath tiles have chicken wire stapled to the sheet rock and then 3/8 cement then the porcelain tile.It took 6 hours with 4lb hammer and concrete chisel to do the back of the tub wall. It took 2 hours to do the wall on the long side about 1 hour to do the wall with the fixtures. The one inch floor tile squares came off with ease. In other words this tool rocks. Word of caution, face shield over safety glasses cannot be over emphasized, mine got two chips! The portion that is black must be the gear box even with leather gloves it is HOT! I used Amsoil grease on the SDS bit shaft and placed a thumbnail amount in the chuck. That seems to help quite a bit as it worked hard for four days ripping out this bathroom.This is my second Bosch tool and it's not made in Mexico or China so this is quality that I can rely on and not worry if it'll last through a job. The D handle comes in handy when leaning body parts to work chipping bit as your whole body and arms get tired and you can't stop.PLUS, this is the only one that had its narrative describe that it was 3 position with Hammer function. If the others had it I overlooked them but was looking hard for this function. The lavatory top had 1 cement and then the tile......this tool ripped right through it with ease. It only takes a slight amount of force exerted on the bit to get the hammer to walk down the line and score the grout and work through your work.Others have nice names based on American built history and rightly; so but the cheap labor quality leaves me out and I'll pay extra for my future Bosch tools.Pro or average Joe, this is a fine tool, light stout and hard working never skipped a beat and the bits is light strong and as of yet the angled chisel has no scares of any damage. Very impressive indeed. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 16:02:00	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

35115876	Sure these don't have the bigger batteries like the others but it also costs about $100 less than those too. I'm just a handyman home owner so I don't need them to last all day and w/ a 30 min charger I always will have a fresh battery ready to go since I'm usually just using one of the two tools at once. So far these tools have been great, I manly bought it for the impact as driving long 3+ screws were killing my old 12v battery drill. This impact drives them it without a sweat.It would be nice however it the tools did have some kind of bit holder in case your switching between bits alot.Price for power and for what you get, this is probably the best deal out there right now at ~$200. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:02:05	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
54964077	From reading the good reviews this tool received, I thought the warnings of blade removal/insertion problems were probably from user lack of reading instructions or brute force.  I am a woman with over 20 years experience with power tools, I read and follow instructions carefully, and I do not force things to their breaking point.  However, after one use with this tool, instructions in hand (having been forewarned), I went to change the blade.  Though I followed instructions to the letter, I couldn't get the blade out.  Again and again I tried, not knowing what I was doing wrong.  The top plastic piece then broke right off leaving me in the middle of a job with no tool to finish.  This tool looks brand new; I had purchased it, used it once, then didn't need it again until after the store would take it back.  They really messed up on this one.  It doesn't matter how good it runs if you can't get a blade in and out. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:02:05	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		true

60966507	This is a fantastic tool for a home owner or craft enthusiast.  The range of small tasks that you can achieve with the Multipro is unbelievable and easy, even for an untrained person.This kit includes a flexi-shaft, which helps you get into corners by extending the accessory bit using a long flexible shaft. You can buy the shaft separately if you already own the tool, but it's cheaper to get it with the kit if you're buying for the first time.  The carrying case is attractive, and fits everything with room to spare.Some of the things you can do with your Dremel tool include drilling holes to hang pictures, putting lot numbers on your house, engraving your initials on items you don't want stolen, sharpening scissors and lawn mower blades, cleaning jewellery or golf clubs, giving sticking doors and windows a quick repair, cleaning silverware or brass or even mag rims, installing your car stereo and adding auto accessories to dress your car, trimming nails that are sticking up, regrooving damaged screw heads, sanding in hard to reach places, and so on.It is however a small tool, so you shouldn't expect it to sand a dining table like a belt sander, or cut out a large wood pattern like a scroll saw.You need a tiny spanner to change accessories, but it's included in the kit, along with different mandrels to hold the bits securely.  There is a wide range of accessories available for even more tasks, and a great additional purchase is the tile cutting attachment, which allows you to do bathroom tile repairs with a lot less mess and guess work.The secret to the Dremel is the speed, with a range of varying speeds up to 35,000 rpm, which you control yourself.  The instruction booklet is very detailed, and gives you lots of tips.  Dremel also has an amazing website, with step by step how-to guides.Every home should have a Dremel Multipro 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:07:43	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

40649767	I received the Genesis Multifunction Oscillating Tool about a week ago.  Compared to bigger name brands, you can't beat the price with a stick.  I have used the semicircular saw accessory to trim some quarter round molding for laminate floors (not real wood) and found that it was slow and left burn marks that needed to be subsequently sanded clean.  But last night I started using it for what I mainly bought it for, after seeing the infomercial for a competitor's product, to scrape original vinyl flooring off a concrete slab in my guest bath in preparation for laying tile.  It is working awesome for that and making the job go quickly.  I got half the bathroom done (5'x 7' floored area) in about an hour, and I am a middle-aged female who has some physical challenges, although will still need to address some adhesive residue left behind (would be nice if it could perform miracles and got all the residue too, but sadly, it doesn't).I am also in the process of refinishing some pieces of furniture and can see this tool coming in handy with sanding corners and some of the detail work that otherwise would have had to have been done by hand.  With the backlog of DIY projects I have right now and a deadline of completing them before guests arrive for the holidays (as well as REALLY wanting to get the toilet back out of my guest bathtub and functional again), any $35 tool that can save me time is more than worth the price.  I would put this on the list, along with a multifunction rotary tool, as a must-have for the home DIY person, especially those who don't have a garage full of tools and don't want to go out and buy them. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:14:17	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

40948569	I have owned this thickness planer for about 6 months and used it for a few projects.  The surfaces are excellent on a variety of woods--so far I've used it on curly maple, cumaru, cherry, poplar, and oak with no issues.  Dust collection is good with just my whining shop vac attached.  Set-up was a snap and worked great right out of the box.So why not 5 stars?  Two reasons: first, the optional extension tables are not at all optional.  Without them, the planer has significant snipe; with them attached there is no appreciable snipe (lt;1/64 at worst).  At this price point the extension tables definitely should have been included, and I would not recommend buying this planer without them.Second, the knives are disposable, which could run into significant expense down the road compared to sharpening them.  Replacement knives run about $50 a set.  Thankfully I haven't needed to replace them as yet. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:16:06	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

57111922	Last week, I had to replace a rusted out anchor bracket in one of my columns that support my patio roof.  After stripping off the stucco finish, I was left with an 8 x 8 treated rough cut post to cut.  Since I planned to splice on to the upper portion of this post after replacing the bracket, a square cut was essential...which eliminated the use of a chainsaw or a reciprocating saw.  I decided I needed another saw when my old saw just about gave out cutting the two treated rough cut 6 x 6 temporary roof braces.  Needing a new saw right away, I went to the local Lowe's and after comparing their products, I decided on the DeWalt DWE575SB.After kerfing all four sides of the post, I used a reciprocating saw to cut the remaining 3.  By nailing guides on all four sides of the post and ended up with a perfectly square cut.  The DeWalt DWE575SB went through this post like a hot knife through butter...effortlessly.  The saw's light weight was another plus when cutting through a vertical post.My reasons for selecting the DeWalt were 1)I owned DeWalt tools in the past, 2)the maximum depth of cut at 90 degrees (2-9/16), 3)the weight of the saw (8.8#), and 4) the electric brake. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:16:06	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

55609240	I bought this one based on other reviews of the 390.  So far it's working great. I used it to feather in my red oak floor instead of using an edger.  I've used a variety of hook/loop discs, all worked fine. The pad isn't showing any signs of coming apart.  The variable speed is nice. The discs didn't wander on the pad.  I'm sold on hook/loop.Possible con:Be aware, the head is large, so if you have smaller hands it could be awkward as some people have mentioned.  I had no difficulty with it. I figure if you can span a fingertip over a dollar bill, you should be easily ok.  Under that will likely come down to personal preference or a two handed grip.I had no trouble with it wandering on me using grits from 60 to 120 on various woods.  The 80 grit left fine swirl marks across oak grain, but above that was ok. I won't say this is the sander since paper, wood, pressure, etc. are all factors which will add up to a result unique to your situation. I found 100+ grit in my application was glass smooth.My one complaint:The dust collector works well, and the suction through the pad holes is doing its job, but the dust which does escape is very, very, fine. This is the first tool I have with this type of hard plastic porous dust collector. It's nice and super easy to clean, but the finest dust goes everywhere. A good dust mask is a must for large projects without a vac.Another interesting feature of this plastic dust collector: In dry weather, it builds up a massive amount of static. Many times I zapped myself taking it off to empty. Not painful, typical socks on carpet + doorknob type zaps.For normal sanding, especially if you have a vacuum, I couldn't fault this item. I'd buy it again, recommend it, or give one as a gift.  It has spent more time out of the case than in at any rate.The case is ok, I got it because it was less $$ than the one without. It holds the sander with lots of room for sanding discs.  This is the only K model difference in the 390 series as far as I'm aware.  Spent less, got the case.The brake is great, the pad stops in 2-3 seconds.  Nice feature, that you don't realize you like until you switch it off the first time.4 instead of 5 stars because of dust collection without a vac, and other brands include a reducer/attachment for a shop vac, which for the $2 worth of plastic should be as common as included safety glasses in nailers. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:17:59	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

48276491	With virtually all products, you can find negative comments. So honestly I was a little reluctant to buy this lathe due to some concerns i read. However, in a similar price point are the Harbor Freight lathes and I read some pretty scary reviews on those lathes. But on this lathe, the price was unbeatable, and if ordered through Amazon the $50 shipping charge from the vendor didn't apply...and I needed a lathe to finish my tall case clock that needed columns in the hood. So I took a chance and bought this lathe. I was surprised at the quality, performance and delivery time. I love this little guy. It's surprisingly heavy for it's size and contrary to other reviews, I had no problem accessing the belt for speed changes. And by the way, it was dead on accurate. I invested in a couple quality turning tools and I turned my walnut columns for the clock without effort. My next project requires turing 29 cherry legs so I'll be buying the extension. If you're looking for a small lathe and you're on a limited budget, in my opinion this is the best value out there. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:19:15	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

58764908	I purchased this saw from Amazon recently when the price dropped to 300 with free shipping.  I feel like I got the deal of a lifetime, and now that I have the saw in my possession, I would have no trouble paying the usual price at which Amazon and Lowe's carry this item.I am moving up from another Delta saw, a TS-300 Shopmaster that falls somewhere between a benchtop and a contractor's saw.  Keep that in mind as you read my comments, because this 36-979 is a huge step up.The cast iron table surface is expansive, and mine is dead flat.  My only complaint in this are is that the main surface area arrived not nearly as smoothly ground as the table wings.  The wings are mirror like, and the main surface is certainly flat enough, but still has tiny swirls and ridges that I am not thrilled about.The saw was well packaged, and arrived without a problem from Eagle Freight.  Everything was in the package and ready to go.The instructions are not the easiest to follow, but they are not as impossible as some other reviewers had me thinking.  You can actually log on to Delta's service site and print out a PDF of the manual if you are concerned (which is what I did before purchasing the saw).  By far the most difficult part is attaching the wheels to the stand.  I have long skinny fingers, and this was still a feat of acrobatics.The only machine tolerance I am not thrilled about (besides the main table surface) is the play in the mounting pins for the motor.  The motor shifts around 1/8 while on the pins, which makes it difficult to keep your setup perfect, especially if you regularly take the motor on and off (like if you are, say, a contractor...).  All the alignment was done perfectly at the factory.  I used my dial indicator, and everything was within .001 of dead-on.The motor absolutely purrs.  Keep in mind, again, that I am stepping up from a direct drive saw that wailed in terror everytime I asked it to turn on.  This motor does definitely draw quite a few amps, though, so I'm not sure how much luck you'd have with a 15 amp circuit.The included blade is the included blade, what more can you say?  Maybe I will make a clock out of it.I was not happy with the throat insert, but it was easy to rout out some zero clearance plates with some 1/2 scrap I had lying around.  These seem to work great.This saw does not come with a fence, but I picked up a Biesemeyer during Lowe's recent punting of those items.  I must admit I find myself opening the garage door regularly just to look at the Bies on my new saw.  It is a thing of beauty, both in appearance and performance.  I had a Unifence on my other table saw, which I also loved, but there is something really fantastic about the weight and stability of the Bies.Dust collection is not fantastic, but it's not terrible, either.  It's nice that the saw includes a chute so that you don't have to purchase that item separately.The off switch is large and hard to miss, and you have some freedom (but not much) as to where you mount it.  I am doing my best to keep the blade guard on, but it is difficult.  I wish it were easier to take on and off for non-through cuts.  As it stands, you have to take off the throat plate and get out a wrench to remove the 2 bolts that hold it on.  I may replace these with wingnuts soon.Even if you can't find the saw at the price I did, I would buy it.  Unless you're willing to drop a few more hundred and get a hybrid or a Grizzly 1023, this is a great saw for the money.  It feels heavy and stable, the motor is plenty powerful for the hobbyist woodworker, and the built-in mobile base (while a pain to assemble) actually works. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:19:15	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

55580344	Once again, another hit from Makita.  I use this router bench mounted so I can't comment on the plunge attachment but for bench work, this tool is great.  My original router was a Hitachi that had the bearings wear out (probably my fault for not property adjusting the RPM).  This tool is very powerful and great for routing harder woods with its variable speed control.  The in bench height adjustment is so so, but you can still accurately set it with some tinkering.  I have run many hardwood raised panel cabinet doors through this tool and it has no issues with the larger diameter bits. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:32:07	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
523530	I am a young guy just married and settled into our first house so I needed some new power tools had some older ones that worked for the projects I had when renting an apt. in a city(not much area for building things) I have always like to build and fix things possibly why I became and engineer. I went back and forth between Milwaukee Tool and Dewalt and the more I looked and price as well as pros and cons from contractor friends and mechanic friends one of them said why do you need pro-grade tools yes they work great and last a long time but he said why dont I save some money and look at like black and decker they are lower cost and work fantasic for what I need. So for Christmas my father in law got us the 20v matrix (I say us because my wife and I build and do projects together she also enjoys it) I have used the Drill, Router, cutoff saw and Impact so far on a recent build and they all worked great) the battery has a good life to it ( I did buy a 2nd battery right away though may not have needed it after using it but nice to have) I would highly recommend this for any DIY person. surely I would not build a house with this even a big deck might be a bit too much for it that I would borrow something better from a friend. but its a great tool at a great price. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:32:07	No Defect		Novice	No		true
36215166	I have owned one of these for about three years now and I have no complaints at all. It really shines when a large 18v is more drill than you need but you don't want to be handicapped by a lack of power. The charger gets the batteries charged up quickly and the whole package is very portable. Ridgid offers a Lifetime Service Agreement which covers every component, including your batteries, so as long as you are careful and hang onto your receipt, or register the tools with Ridgid, you'll never have to worry about needing to buy new batteries when they run out of life. I can testify to the LSA because I just had both batteries replaced and the only thing I had to do was take them (along with the drill  charger) down to a local service center and within a week I had two new batteries. I can't ask for anything better from a company. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:32:07	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

42422914	This is actually my first nailer and probably my last.  The build quality is second to none.  I've used it to do repairs and for some of my own creations as well.  Nailing into soft and hard woods is of the utmost ease.  The exhaust port is a little snug and therefore difficult to turn but adds to the feeling of sturdiness that is so reassuring.  You know that it won't slip and point in the wrong direction while you're not looking.  I usually run anywhere between 80 and 90 PSI.  I can't comment on how easy it is to clear jams because I simply  haven't had one yet and I've driven over 1000 nails to this point.  It's much lighter than you would expect.  The case is adequate.

36807448	Really quite a nice cordless power drill.  It's small but has enough power to handle most home projects.  I've used it to drill holes in wood and drive screws on several wood working units.  The battery holds out for quite a while.  It is lithium, however, it is not detachable, and it takes some time to recharge.  Therefore, it will be necessary to recharge it at every opportunity.There is a screwdriver bit that attaches to the lower end.  It is very easy to dislodge it, so I reccommend it be taped over or stored seperately to avoid loss.The price is so very nominal that I advise buying two of them.  Using two together allows two seperate bits to be used at once and gives backup power in case one battery dies.  I found this to be invaluable while working on various wood projects that required two or more size drills.All in all, this is a very useful tool that I find myself using more than I thought I would.  It is well made and durable.  It should last for many years. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:45:15	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

25582606	I cut a lot of conduit at work and had used band saws belonging to others several times. Finally I decided to take the plunge and buy one of my own. I had never used a deep-cut model and will probably never cut anything larger than unistrut, so my selection was based on the variable-speed feature more than anything else. To cut to the chase, this saw is a bit awkward to use...Milwaukee located the motor dead in the line of sight of the blade and it's harder to get and keep the cut on a line than with the standard depth saw. It cuts very well and the variable speed control is great, but after using the standard depth model (which affords great visibility for making cuts) this one is somewhat of a letdown. Had I tried one in the field first I would not have bought one. In terms of quality, it's a Milwaukee...!

31599194	I like the size, and the vac has pretty good suction. Nails and bits of wire get pulled up, but not very far. The handle came cracked on one end. The handle would feel better if it were smooth on the inside instead of honeycomb where the fingers actually lift. Dumping the dust from the base is messy. An incorporated external vortex chamber would have been a really good idea, catching the majority of debris first and being easier to dump. The basic vac comes without suction heads for the floor, and without a sponge for wetvac operation. The sponge wet filter would have been a cheap and easy give away, and seems like it would have increased the usufulness at little extra cost. Perhaps the sales strategy was to upsell the extras packages. It just made me feel shortchanged. The cord is adequate length, but could have been a bit longer. Hose storage is almost nonexistent, the single hook that snaps on to the base only holding the end of the hose, not several loops. There is no cord storage strategy. It does come on Auto well when the crosscut saw turns on, and off when off, the dust seems fairly well collected, but if auto is not on, dust goes all over, and it is not easy to visualize the on/off  with either of the two buttons (Power and Auto). It is fairly quiet, and lightweight. The cloth filter shakes out easily,but once again, gets dust on the shaker easily. I tried to keep the wind at my back, but it was strong enough to have eddies blow it back on me. The attempt to bag the debris was hindered by having nothing underneath to hold onto with one hand while holding the plastic bag with the other hand.Yes, I would buy it again, because I still feel the engineering is good, but the vaulue is not as strong for the money given as I had hoped. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:56:02	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

45343666	I bought this to cut down some brass ammo cases for loading 300AAC Blackout, its PERFECT! I ordered an assortment of blades at the same time, each of which are top quality, true carbide blades, no chinese garbage. I have already found another 50 uses for this saw in my shop, I love it, and the tolerances of every adjustable part are tight, much better than my full size chop saw (Delta). I wish I would have purchased this 10 years ago! Oh, oops, and the seller was great too!! They shipped it perfectly and timely and in better condition than you could find it on a store shelf.

61195518	I purchased the Bosch tool set in late December. I am a contractor who needs durable and reliable tools. When I started my search, I researched the Porter Cable, Milwaukee and Dewalt cordless sets. I have all three brands in corded/pneumatic tools and have been satisfied with their performance. I limited my search to these brands until I saw the Bosch.Hands down, the build of Bosch was superior to the other three. And their attention to little things makes me very glad I made the purchase. For example:1. The drill with its hook is invaluable, especially when hanging sheetrock. It is heavier than the others, but sturdier in the hand.2. The reciprocating saw has an adjustable foot and varying blade stroke. Both features are used often by me. My job has me cutting pipe, 2 by's, sheetrock, etc. and these features have made the job easier.3. The circular saw comes with and exhaust port to attach to my portable vac. I can cut inside now with limited dust. Additionally the depth gage is handy4. The jig saw with the blow port helps keep the line open to the eye and the ability to change the orbital action is great when stepping up the cut. (the saw works the best with bosch t-blades)5. Ok - the light is the worst - Dewalts is much better.The kicker in making the decision to purchase the Bosch was the 3 year warranty. I have had to use it once already. The head on the recip saw broke. I was sent a new one in a few days and was up and running. I get the feeling that the head has been an issue. The new one I received was made different.The bag is a bit of a pain, but it does allow me to carry the charger, and three cases containing recip saw blades, jigsaw blades and drill bits.For the money, the Bosch Cordless set is a very good choice. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 16:59:38	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		true
57820321	As a female who only uses tools to hang the occasional curtain rode or put a desk together it works great. Having never used a drill before it seemed pretty self explanatory and simple to figure out. On the two occasions I have used it over the past few months there have not been any problems.

43740770	I am really glad I spent the extra money for the oil-lube model.  It is not very noisy.  I only started using it today, and so far I am very pleased.  My one complaint is that the manual is not very helpful for those of us who have not used air tools before.  It really needs at least two hoses to take advantage of the remote regulator (another great feature), and it needs the quick connetcing couplers, since most of the good hoses come without the quick connectors.  Luckily, I had bought the Porter- Cable accessory pack that had the needed couplers.  It's like getting a toy without the batteries, if you do not have all the required atachments when the compressor arrives. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 17:02:06	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
59736233	I've used this screwdriver for everything from hanging wooden blinds, installing child locks on the kitchen cabinet doors, and removing and replacing the switchplates when I paint a room to name a few.

24513254	Based on my research, and experience this product is the best choice. I am a previous construction industry worker, as well as a previous small business owner in the #34;property preservation#34; sector, where you had to be a well versed handyman. This product has versatility, as well as ease of use, and that alone speaks volumes. I am particularly fond of the ability to quick change a tool. Some might be concerned that the quick change aspect might not hold the tool well, and be kind of #34;sloppy#34; in it's performance versus a tool required #34;chuck#34;, but I can tell you that Porter Cable put a great deal of thought/engineering into a snug/secure fit. You'll see once you go to set a tool in the arbor as to how secure it is.  It also has more than enough power to tackle most any job, and I give it an excellent rating. I have a number of other Porter Cable products, belt sander, 2 different size brad nailers, a pancake air compessor, and this company can stand #34;toe to toe#34; with any other, and I own a number of other competitor's products. So, I speak from the perspective of an #34;average joe#34; homeowner/handyman, as well as a previous small construction industry business owner, this product #34;ROCKS#34;. I am now retired, and I bought this product specifically for doing a #34;whole house#34; exterior recaulking project. I will have to be up on a ladder at some significant heights, and this tool is going to help from a safety perspective. Thanks Porter Cable!!! 	rgruss	10-25-2015 17:02:06	No Defect		Expert	No		true

50511945	I already owned the right handed saw just like this one so I knew what to expect for the most part. I like the saw and it feels the same as the right handed milwaukee tilt-lok I bought 7 years ago (used it a lot since then too) as far as quality goes. I had been wanting this saw to be made for years and the other day I saw it online. I always wanted a left and right handed saw of the same brand and model to have on the job. I never cared for any porter cable tools and that is the only lefty saw I ever see anywhere anymore.I like that it has a five year warranty in case something unexpected went wrong on it.The case is nice and the wrench is standard but it does not come with a rip guide.I use the saw both left and right handed depending on what I'm cutting and it is equally comfortable. I like that during right handed use I don't have to lean over to see the blade/ cut line. It does feel a little weird at first but your back will appreciate it if you are like me and your body is starting to age.Another user said it was not safe for right handed use. I disagree, I have no problem but then again I have a lot of experience with saws and so forth as it is how I make my living- I believe in safety very strongly.I would reccomend using a dewalt yellow rim blade. I like the 24t for framing and the 40t for finish. The blade that comes in the saw cuts good but throws material in the direction of your face a little too much for me. Dewalt has always made the best normal priced blade in my opinion. I like the Milwaukee saw though. Makita blades are ok too.I would reccomend this saw to any other pro carpenter. If you build only decks you might want to go worm drive- nothing pulls a saw like wet pressure treated lumber. Don't get me wrong this saw has plenty of power and is plenty tough for all carpentry work on a daily use basis. I could just see someone who is putting it through max wet lumber duty daily could want the hypoid as the overall construction is a little more solid. On the plus this is an extremely powerful saw for it's size.My old right handed one has helped me finish a lot of jobs. Milwaukee has always built a good product from my experience. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 17:08:48	No Defect		Expert	No		true
52304476	I used to be a Dewalt and Craftsman user primarily.  We originally got a set similar to this a few years ago.  It was the 4 piece set with just the Reciprocating saw, Drill, Circular Saw, and the flashlight.  My buddy recommended them and told me they were on a great sale at the local Home Depot.I was skeptical but thought I'd return them if I didn't like them.  The lights on them seemed silly, the belt clips seemed like unnecessary pieces sticking out, and the flashlight seemed like filler to make it a 4 piece set instead of the 3 piece set.Fast-forward a few years and I had to leave my set with my mom and her boyfriend to take care of the landscaping and other jobs around their house I used to do and I'm happily buying a bigger set for myself with no worries that they'll last quite a long time.  I've known multiple people to use these professionally now (I've even recommended them to a few of those guys) and no one has had any complaints or failures that I know of.I did check the Dewalt and other makers just to be sure these were still the best and based on the reviews, the tech specs that matter to me, and the little features these offer that others don't I quickly bought these.The belt clips will be a feature you can't live without when you get used to them.  I've climbed extremely high extension ladders with the #34;Sawzall#34; clipped on my belt to cut off a breaking tree branch.  I would have had to tie a rope and pull up any other brand.  Mounting pictures or other tasks is quicker and easier when you can just hang the drill on your belt or pocket to free your hands and you don't have to bend down to pick it up or put it down.We've all had to get into a tight space with a drill and the lights on these really do help.  The lights on all of the tools make it much easier to see what you're doing and that is essential when you're dealing with power tools that could hurt you.I plan on expanding my LXT arsenal now that I'm buying a slight #34;fixer upper#34; and I look forward to using them all for years to come. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 17:08:48	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

29838904	I read the reviews posted on this sander, and they pretty well outlined what to expect.  The Bosch 1276D is heavy and powerful.  It is a perfect addition to my wood work tools as I have a light weight belt sander for the little jobs. Much more sander than what I need, but perfect for the big jobs, and no worry of hurting it for lack of power.  For the price it is better than what I had expected.  Don't get hooked into some of the so called rebuilt-refurbished companies that charge more than the new price.  Cheaper by far than any of the same models that I looked at on Ebay.  If you need a good HEAVY DUTY sander this is the one to pick.  Requires some strong arms to use and control it. The exhaust could have been vented the other direction, but I still give it a 5 star.  Also five stars to the seller for fast shipping-good price and good communication with a UPS tracking number. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 17:10:32	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

46127632	This compressor is fairly small and light, it measures 11 by 5 by 8.5 inches and weighs probably under 2 pounds. According to the manual, it draws 3 Amps at 120 Volts, which makes it at least 3-5 times more powerful than a portable compressor powered from auxiliary socket (those are typically limited to lt;10 Amps at 12 V). Performance-wise, it seems to be beating cheap $20-range compressors by a factor of 5 to 10. It takes about 30 seconds to pump a sizeable SUV tire (e.g., 235-65-R17) from 28 psi to 32 psi. At this speed, adding air to the tires is a fast and easy process.This great performance does not come as a surprise. Generally, 12 V sockets in cars are protected with 10 Amps fuses, which limits the power which compressors can draw to 120 Watts maximum. The best portable compressors run at 20-30 Amps but they have to be connected directly to the car's battery, which is a somewhat messy and sometimes dirty process. With at least three times greater power (360 Watts) and larger air pump size one can expect much faster performance from this compressor - and it does deliver.It creates a fair amount of noise, in my judgment close to the noise level of a typical vacuum cleaner. Since pumping time is usually short (unless the tire is completely empty), noise is not an issue, and in any case it is quite tolerable.The round bright display is a nice feature, but unfortunately it is quite inaccurate. My compressor shows approximately 4 psi lower pressure than a portable digital gauge and TPMS display in the car. Hence, I have to set  in to 35-36 psi in order to get actual pressure to 32 psi. It is frustrating to see such inaccuracy in a fairly expensive compressor - they probably could've made it accurate by spending extra thirty cents on the parts but they did not. This is the only reason why I ranked it four stars. You have to have either a separate tire pressure gauge or TPMS with pressure indicator in the car just to calibrate the compressor, or you need to get it freshly pumped to a target pressure by a tire shop or using a more accurate compressor. Then you can plug this one in and it will show you what reading this correct pressure corresponds to on its scale.The compressor comes with one year warranty, which is nice as it suggests some level of quality. It does not come with a power cord, but I do not see it as an issue because one has to use an extension cord anyway to be able to reach every tire on the car, and extension cord can be plugged directly into the compressor. The good part is that it comes with a wall hanger and screws to hang it in the garage.Since it is automatic - you dial in the desired pressure (with the correction for the gauge error) and push the start button - it is very easy to operate, and there is no need to watch the pressure as it runs. When the target pressure is reached, it shuts off by itself. To pump the next tire, you disconnect the air hose from the valve stem, connect to the next tire, and press the red button again. Very easy.I used in only on 8 tires so far and can't judge the build quality and reliability, but so far the impression has been very positive. Compared to my portable emergency compressor, this one is nicer, quieter, and SO MUCH FASTER! Of course, this speed comes at a price of portability - you need 120 V to plug it in, and obviously it requires too much power to be compatible with a basic 100 - 175 W car inverters. It is a compressor for home, to be kept on the garage wall to be used to add air to the tires ones per month for fuel efficiency, etc.It is a pity that they did not built in a flashlilght into it as it would be helpful if one has to work in a poorly lighted conditions. The screen creates some light, but not quite enough if you use the compressor it in a garage in shadow of the car.The manual is very detailed and clearly written - even though the operation is so simple that one hardly needs the manual.Overall, I think it is a good choice for home use. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 17:15:03	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

59696734	Like the old saying - you get what you pay for.  Sure, it works fine, but watch out if you are looking for a variable speed drill.  The trigger on this thing is either on full speed or off.  It is very hard, or impossible to try to control the speed.  Also, don't think that you'll get a keyless chuck, or one you can operate with your hand.  You have to have the key, like the old style.  Other than that, it works fine - like I said, you get what you pay for. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 17:17:23	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
57167433	...our dog absolutely hates both the noise and the feeling that this makes against his claws.  He is a lab/border collie mix.  We got this because he always makes such a ruckus at the vet getting his nails clipped.  I was afraid to trim his nails, and thought this would be a good compromise.Since our dog hated this so much we couldn't keep him still, we ordered the bamboo nail clippers instead and he likes those a lot better.If your dog is sensitive to noise, I would avoid this product. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 17:17:23	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

26725376	Bear in mind that this is the only router I have ever owned. The router lives up to the hype as far as I can tell. I've had no problems with the collet but I wonder if those who have had trouble are using 1/4quot; bits with the collet reducing adapter ?. The geared and free plunge work well. The ability to raise the collet out of the base and lock it for bit changes is a fantastic feature. There is PLENTY of power. It is solidly made. My two criticisms would be: 1. The user manual is too brief and hard to understand: Since the controls are interlocked, you do have to operate them in a specific order. Get this wrong and it might seem that the mechanism is jammed. 2. It is a bit on the heavy side. To be expected from a relatively high power motor, but awkward if you are routing free hand - not in a table. I'd give it five stars if I had more experience with other models. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 17:17:23	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
65948396	I wouldn't try grinding heavy steel with it but for light to medium jobs this rotary tool gets the job done. I can buzz through schedule 40pvc 1 inch pipe like it's wet paper. I like how it steadily raises is rpms instead of getting there as fast as possible when it first starts that will save wear on the motor. Lastly this tool really has some balls to it, I have a buzz saw from my previous rotary and it burns through every type of heavy plastic I can throw at it.My only mark down is the few  bits that come with it are few and only so so.

24277051	I love power tools and don't usually give my opinion until I have reached a conclusion. I thought I would have to use this one for a while until I made up my mind as to if it was good or bad. It only took me a few uses to know I had a winner! It is a well balanced tool. I thought it would vibrate alot but only minimal. Just the right size. Very comfortable fit in the hand. The blade changing was real easy and well made. Looks like it should last for a long time. I really like that I can vary the oscillations to what ever speed I want. Sometimes you just want to be careful at what you are doing and want to ease into your work and not go full bore like some tools you turn on and you don't have full control of their cutting abiliy. The usage of different blade manufacturers is a big plus as is the nice carrying case. You can't go wrong buying this tool even if you only use it every once in a while for those special projects that other tools won't do the job. It's a keeper! 	rgruss	10-25-2015 17:19:23	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

52058138	Received boxed product all good. Had to buy a nipple for the air attachment, (not attached or included). Bought that and while tightening it into place I snapped the housing for the nipple. I didn't cross-thread or over-torque it. I needed the gun for a job immediately and went to a nearby repair shop and store. They told me it would be three weeks until their next Senco order went out and longer for the repair. So I bought a Hitachi which I am very happy with right out of the box. Having the Senco fixed and may keep it despite the hassle. Wasted several hours and am disappointed with the flimsy casting.

41095615	First realize this product is a kit, not a finished assembled product!!  That said, my kit I got arrived in quite good shape.  Understanding that it is a collection of thin metal pannels,and other hardware, and perhaps a million small nuts bolts and washers.  The actual product box was inclosed in an outer shipping box.  Perhaps the model that I recieved was updated because it appears as though there was considerable packaging effort to get it to me safe.  There was even plate glass for the window that made it to me unscathed!  One or two of the pannels were a bit damaged.Next important point....  It is NOT a one man job to assemble!!!! so dont even try to do this solo.  I am mechanically inclined and I work on cylinder heads as a hobby but still putting this thing together was daunting.Third.  It will take several hours. But is it well worth it to invest the time to build it right the first time. Tighten those fastners like you dont ever want to have to touch them again.Fourth.  Follow another reviewer's advice and seal up the seams with caulk.  My kit came with rolls of adhesive foam strip seals but this is easily damaged when putting together the main chamber.There was a fault in the gun supplied with my kit but after a thorough inspection, I saw the bit of metal left from machinin the gun which was blocking the media passage into the air stream.  I got rid of that and the unit worked fine with some medium grit black beauty that I got.So why did I give this four stars? In a word, price!  For the price I think its well worth it.  Once you get it together, and get it sealed it does the job it was designed to do perfectly.  The only reason I would pay 100 bucks more for a simmilar cabinet was if it came assembled... that is the only thing that would justify the price.I also appreciate the fact that the unit came with an assortment of ceramic nozels and several replacement plastic sheilds for the viewing screen.  I've made some mods so that it functions better for me.  This included longer hoses for the gun, both for the media feed and for the air.  I find I also need more light inside of the cabinet.I'm pleased with the product. 	rgruss	10-25-2015 17:24:37	No Defect		Expert	No		true
51559088	I got this just over a year ago for Christmas when my mom heard me state that I needed a new one.  I picked it, not her, but when I was shopping I figured the cheaper one would work.  I had the Ingersoll 1215Ti for many years and loved it.  This new one is already down on power, and the head spins free of the body, making it hard to single handed put a socket on a nut in a tight space without the head moving.

59192579	I have had several cordless drills over the years, and I have read the reviews on this and others.  My research paid off.  I really like this palm-sized cordless a lot.  It's small enough to slip into your pocket, and while there is no clip or holder to hold bits on the drill, that doesn't really matter, because Skil provides a set of 5 bits in a tiny rubber holder that you  can easily slip into your pocket and not even notice it.  One complaint about other cordless drills is that the bits fall out (like when you're up on a ladder).  Well, this has a magnetic holder which holds the bits snugly so they don't fall out, but are easily pulled out to change. It also feels great in your hand.  Not too big or too small, and has a comfortable rubber grip.  Haven't had it long enough to comment on its long term durability, but it seems really well made. Of course, Skil is owned by Robt. Bosch, and while it may be their lower end line, there is nothing low-end about this screwdriver.  Seems to be very good quality. The light, low battery indicator and lithium battery are icing on the cake. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 21:24:47	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
22450733	I've needed a new jig saw for quite some time, since my old one gave up the ghost. But not being a serious woodworker, it was something I just wouldn't commit myself to buying. Not because I didn't need one (ask the folks I've borrowed one from), but because I just didn't have the time to sort through all the ins-and-outs of jig saws. What speed? How many amps? What tools did I need to go with it?Well, if you need a good jig saw for those around-the-house projects such as building shelves, etc., look no more! As noted in the details, the 6amp JS680V Jigsaw will deliver any cut you need in almost any material that can be cut! Unsure what speed setting you need? It's easy with the Smart-Select Dial, which allows you to just set it for the project you need, and the saw automatically adjusts its speed. This was awesome for me, because I don't like looking at my tools wondering where I put the manual or what a certain setting is for. Keep in mind, this is NOT a band saw. But it will make some nice cuts where you need them. Some may say that this does not compare to a $200 DeWalt or Makita, but to me I don't need that level of a saw. The Black  Decker JS680V does the same thing those saws do for a third of the price!This saw also comes with the LineFinder system, which is a rather unique concept. Instead of using the traditional laser, which of course can't follow curves, the linefinder consists of a special UV-type pen that looks like a highlighter. The light on the saw illuminates the lines that you draw on your project almost like a blacklight. It's actually pretty impressive. I can't say how well it will hold up, long term, or how much a replacement pen will cost, but I'm hopeful it will hold up. I can see it being especially helpful when making curvy cuts.As noted, the JS680V Jigsaw feels very durable and well-built. It has rubber gripping along the handle, which allows for a solid grip while using it. It also has a cast shoe, which seems as solid as any other brand I checked out. The shoe is then covered with heavy plastic so it glides smoothly. And you don't need any special tools to change out the blades, which is nice. The saw is weighty, but is not too heavy in the hands for most folks to use.Finally, as a casual user, there are two small features that I really like: first, the saw comes with a magnetic on board blade storage that will hold 3 blades. It's basically a little storage compartment on the side. So no more digging around wondering where I put that extra blade! The other feature is that you can easily change the angle adjustment, and it has bevel markings that show you the bevel (15/30/45) through an indicator window, taking the guess-work out of whether you have it set right.Overall, you will not be disappointed with this saw. I really feel that Black  Decker has stepped up the quality of their products lately, and the JS680V Jigsaw demonstrates this as well as anything. The only thing that I can see that would add to the overall value would be for BD; to include cutting blades for metal or plastic (it comes with a blade for wood), and a kit box for storage. As it stands, you have to find someplace to put it when not in use, which of course requires that you remove the blade so it doesn't get broken or you don't get cut. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 21:24:47	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

82347199	I wanted a powerful multi-tool because my first one from Sears, a rechargeable, with wrench for blade changes,  was a weakling and would stall and battery would wear out in no time. And blade changes were a hassle . .  you could never get it tight enough, and the hex receptacle got stripped. Sears put that one out before it was fully baked. In fact, it's off the market now.So, I went for this Rockwell multi-tool with electric cord and 3.0 AMPS.  . . . .HOLY MACKERAL this thing sizzles, cuts moldings and creates clearances etc. Worth every penny in the time it saves me!  I don't have to worry about a low battery. And the quick release/locking system works great...after I figured out all the ins and outs of how that locking handle worked.  It has a good case, and long enough power cord. Rockwell did their homework. Really!  Plus this tool can take many other makes of blades, so you never get stuck. Changing the non-Rockwell tools takes an extra step, but at least it can do it, and you never worry about having to find a certain make of blade.It's heavier than my first mult-tool, but not problem, that's what you get with more power. It's well balanced. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 21:29:11	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

46389975	I have a 20gal compressor but turning that thing on just to inflate a tire or two is overkill.  What's worse is a couple of my tires loose 2-3 psi over the course of a week during the winter (even with remounting and new stems).  This inflator is exactly what you need.  Set it to desired pressure, turn it on, and walk away.  Gone are the days of measure, fill, measure, fill...  This item is a great time saver.  It is only about $25 over the cost of a brand name 120V air inflator--definitely worth it.  I actually love the fact that it has no power cord because those usually need another extension cord anyways.  It also comes with a nice wall mount.

The professional, or the person with a lot of money who just likes to collect fancy tools.I'm a pro, and will be putting this tool to work everyday. Out of the box you will be instantly impressed.Long lasting smart batteries, Li-Ion technology, well constructed, and a charger that lets you know when it's charged or ready for replace.Everything I expect out a tool like this has met it's reputation. You want long lasting power? You got it. You want quality? You got it.If you want something cheaper, go to the outlet mall and find some crappy reconditioned tool.Edit: 2 years from purchase date.

40767667	As a small fellow, I bought this primarily because it was so light.  It is certainly easier to handle.  However, you do have to hold it strongly with both hands.  It develops so much torque and has so little mass to resist, kickback is definitely more of a problem than with my old Sears Craftsman.  I've experienced it climbing up the workpiece and running backwards across it, particularly with a narrow kerf blade like that intended for plywood.That said, if held securely, it's a very good saw.  The case is roomy and appreciated.  And the handle adjustments are quick and convenient. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 21:32:42	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

58609891	There are a lot of reciprocating saws on the market today; unfortunately some masquerade as a 'Sawzall', but Milwaukee invented the genre decades ago and, quite frankly, nothing is even in the same league as a genuine 'Sawzall'.  DeWalt, Makita, Ryobi, Hitachi, Porter Cable all make reciprocating saws; some are professional grade, some say they are and some are just consumer models.  When you decide either through using lesser tools or simply want to own the very best, Milwaukee stands head and shoulders above the competition in the reciprocating saw market.Consider some of the features found on this model Milwaukee:11 amps of power and it feels like more.  This is one big, robust saw, period.Detachable cord.  Only Milwaukee figured out the ways people use a reciprocating saw--constant, demanding ROUGH use.  These saws are most typically used in demolition work.  In this environment you run the saw relentlessly and go through some blades.  When you want to change one, in a hurry, nothing on earth is handier than being able to simply unclick the power cord and do a blade change.  Believe me, you wouldn't want to change a blade on this beast without it being unplugged.Orbital action.  When you're rough cutting lumber, nothing assists you like an orbital action.  This allows the blade to more aggressively cut through the material with less binding and less discomfort to the operator.Anti-vibration.  I don't know the technical nuances of how Milwaukee cancels out the vibration, but this saw is the smoothest (from an operator's standpoint) saw I've ever used.  Any recip saw can truly rattle your fillings when it binds, but fortunately this Milwaukee has anti-vibration and a clutch, that genuinely minimizes feedback to the operator.Easy blade change chuck.  This has got to be the simplest blade change known to man.  Rotate the collet about 1/4 turn and you're in business.  NOTHING could be easier.Variable speed dial.  What a nice touch!  Instead of relying solely on trigger pressure for speed control, Milwaukee thoughtfully provides a speed dial.  Set it to half and you can pull the trigger back all the way and run at half speed.  Demo work doesn't usually involve feathering the trigger, so this is a godsend.Typical Milwaukee construction.  Want to find out how good Milwaukee's reputation is in the building trades?  Go to a jobsite.  ANY jobsite.  Residential, commercial, plumbing, electrical, it doesn't matter.  First, stop by and ask any professional what they think of Milwaukee.  Second, look for the RED tools (Milwaukee's trademark).  Every jobsite has Milwaukee.  The pros respect them because they don't break.I brought this tool home on a Sunday and had to cut up 15 pallets to downsize them for garbage disposal.  If you've EVER had the fun task of cutting up pallets, you can appreciate that the wood is FULL of nails (everywhere) and it's genuinely very hard, dense wood.  Has to be to support the loads that pallets carry.  I chucked in a new Milwaukee blade and 30 minutes later there was over 10 pounds (yes I weighed it!!) of sawdust and a BUNCH of small boards left.  Saying the Milwaukee cut the boards like a hot knife through butter, in my mind, does a disservice to the hot knife!  I ran the saw until it became so hot I couldn't hold it anymore, which is being overly severe to any tool; I just wanted to see if Milwaukee's vaunted reputation was as deserved as people say.  It is.  The saw NEVER stopped running; I honestly believe I could have put on gloves and kept going, but did allow the saw to cool down and resumed cutting.  If a nail was hit, it bucked a little and just went on through it.  It's a beast, plain and simple.It's a very specific product, but one with a ton of uses.  If you've never used a recip saw before, I would caution you to always make sure your item being cut is safely secured; a recip saw of this size has enough strength to easily move anything that is loosely held.  Always be sure of what's under or behind the blade; if it's a concrete driveway or asphalt, you can damage the tool, but REALLY damage the driveway!  Wear boots and safety goggles, this thing takes NO prisoners.  And for heaven's sake, if you're demo'ing a wall, make absolutely certain that there are no live electrical wires present.This saw isn't for everyone; it's pricey for single, consumer use.  But, if you want the very best made reciprocating saw made, look no further than the Milwaukee Super Sawzall.  It's the class leader by a BIG margin. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 21:32:42	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
28468678	I bought the PC305tp as a second planer. I have a Grizzly 15 inch planner that is a 3 cutter head heavy cast iron build with a 2 hp motor (I believe they are now 3 hp standard). I have about 1200 board feet of a mix of white pine,oak,cherry,ash and maple with about 1/2 still in the rough and the other half lightly planed. I have a storage shed about 50 feet from my shop and I didn't want to drag all the lumber to the shop to plane and then back to the shed for storage. All the lumber I have was board run so there are some really nice boards and some with a bunch of defects to work around and as such I wanted to clean it all up and cut out all the defects so as to only have perfect usable boards in the storage shed. So my solution was the Porter Cable pc305tp which is the same planer as Delta tp305 as far as I can tell so you can read all the reviews for that planer and it would hold true for the Porter Cable.So pushing all the lumber through the Porter Cable is really pushing it and my sense is it's not a good idea. I set the planer up in about 1/2 hr. no problems--adjusting the feed tables carefully will help minimize snipe. I ran several boards through -- cherry and pine and it did a good job with negligible snipe --I set up a roller support about several feet from the planer on the out feed side and set it level to the bed of the planer and hence no significant snipe that couldn't be taken out with light sanding. It worked harder for the cherry then the pine (expected) and the boards I ran through were about 6 to 10 inches wide and 10 ft long. I kept feeling the motor to see if it was getting hot and it didn't feel warmer then what I would have expected. I didn't take more then 1/4 turn and sometimes a bit less and it took several passes for each board. The milling of the boards will effect how many passes it takes--band saw mills in my experience yield smoother lumber than circular mills. Anyway I feel pretty confident that if I get through this pile in small batches it will not over tax the machine. The only thing that concerns me is that all the competing models have overload reset buttons to protect the motors. If anyone knows I would be interested to understand better if it is needed or is the 20 amp breaker in the service panel enough. The thermal reset buttons on the machines I looked at were 18 amp breakers which I think is how much overload is allowable with a Service Factor of 1 for a 15 amp rated motor which is what most all the 12-1/2 portable planers are. I ordered an 18 amp breaker from a Dewalt parts dealer that I was planning on installing in a connector box just before the planner -- I would still appreciate others posting review on this machine to share their thoughts on this concern --but still for the money a good portable planer if you take your time , keep the knives sharp and run small batches at a time.

31843368	I'm impressed! This compressor is better than I expected.I looked at compressors in the under $200 category for weeks.  I never found a Senco in a store to look over, but I wasn't finding anything else that fit my wants as well as this one, so I ordered it and hoped for the best.  As soon as I took it out of the box I could see that the build quality beat all the others I had looked at.1. The frame is powder coated and the finish is as hard as tooth enamel.  Many others in this price range had painted frames (and tanks), which would eventually chip and begin to rust.2. The discharge hose (hose from compressor to tank) is covered in braided stainless steel.  You could drop an axe on it and you wouldn't compromise the hose.  Almost everything else I looked at in the stores had a standard EPDM (rubber) hose with internal textile reinforcement.  Drop a knife on that and it would probably nick the hose.3. The regulator body is a machined part.  Others use cheap cast aluminum.4. The motor is vibration isolated from the frame.  Consequently, this compressor is pretty quiet as compressors go.  In addition, it stays put and doesn't walk all over the floor.5. It is perfectly balanced at the handle.  When you pick it up, it doesn't rotate to one side.I know that cast aluminum regulator bodies and EPDM hoses are adequate, but it's nice to know that this compressor was built with that extra bit of quality.  In addition, it is obvious when using this compressor that it meets or exceeds all of the published specifications.I'm very happy with this purchase.UPDATE 4-23-2014:I just used this compressor in our bathroom remodeling job to power a framing nailer.  I was sinking the heads of 3-inch nails below the surface of the wood in two 2 X 6's stacked on top of each other, every time.  I could shoot about six nails before the compressor needed to recover, and recovery about 10 - 15 seconds.  No problem for a small DIY project.  And for the record, my framing nailer is cheap!  It's no high-efficiency model at all.Also, dialing in the output pressure is really smooth.I am very pleased with this little workhorse.

41566327	Have had the 9 piece set for about 4 weeks now and its so far met all my expectations. The only tool I haven't used yet is the cut-out tool but this will probably save the day on some project eventually.As a woman one thing I really like is the shape of the battery; it is easy to get your hand around to release it from the charger one-handed. My last Bosch battery was so wide I couldn't do that and it was very awkard.On the down side the hammer drill/driver is a bit heavy compared to the Bosch, not so heavy that I can't use it but heavy enough to make my thumb ache after a day screwing down siding! Its a great tool though. 3 speeds plus the hammer feature.The circular saw is awesome, lightweight and lightening fast, cuts through stuff like butter. Storage bags are very practical, much better than hard cases. Even the flashlight that I didn't think I'd use is great, powerful light and no more crapped out batteries.Battery life seems good though I haven't owned the set long enough to see any problems.All in all a great set for a great price.

43386555	This folding table set is an essential accessory for the DeWalt 735 planer. Without it it is really difficult to feed the boards straight into the planer, avoiding the snipe (uneven finish at the front and back edge of the board being planed).The build quality is high, installation easy. Make sure you adjust the tables after installation to be exactly level with the planer's table. This is easily done (see instructions enclosed w. the accessory).In principle you could build a wooden in-feed / outfeed table yourself, but it would be difficult to make it exactly co-planar with the planer's table, and it would probably cost more than this product.Sometimes the planer actually comes as a package with these tables and spare set of knives (check prices).Amazon delivered the product quickly.

56384210	One is left to wonder if they have switched to the red lithium batteries yet. Local stores just started getting sets with the new red lithium batteries. They were released last year(Sept/Oct) so it would be nice to know if they have worked they way through the channel yet. Retail stores seem to have mixed results. Considering the timeline and lifetime of the batteries it would be nice to know how old they are before you get them. Some of Amazons kits have been updated to mention red lithium, others like this one have not... I would love to be able to order knowing which battery would arrive. You have to wonder how many of the negative reviews of batteries are simply due to the advanced age of cells. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 21:51:04	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

22451381	The rip fence is absolutely useless, your only chance to get a good cut is to use a square and manually hold the square or clamp it down while you push the tile throughthe motor mount is not a clean 90 degree angle as well, the weight of the motor bends the frame and the tile blade is not perpendicular to what it is cutting and bogs down because of too much friction and a lack of motor powerI was so frustrated with this saw that the same day I drove to Lowes and bought a real tile saw for $300+The only reason I am giving the tile saw more than 1 star is because it is a fair price for what you get, for the small tile saws under $150 it is typical, my advice is to avoid all these low end saws where you have to use your hand to push the tile and get a tile saw with a tray or a moving bridge, if you must get a cheap tile saw get one where the blade is under mount like a table saw 	winp0007	10-25-2015 21:51:04	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

31270616	This is a tremendous value that shouldn't be taken lightly.  If you're looking for an all around use drill set (yes, you need the driver and the drill) look no further. I've used several drills from dirt cheap ones to very high end ones like Festool and this set rules them all.Power is the most important aspect in drilling.  A drill that isn't powerful enough will only create frustration. The driver part of this set is powerful enough to drive large lag bolts through thick 2 x 4 lumber and the included drill has enough torque at various speed settings to drill through heavy gauge steel with a decent quality bit. These tough boys will do the vast majority of general purpose jobs from woodworking to construction. They are a lot more powerful drills out there, but do you really need it?  Bare in mind that some of the other drills and drivers sometimes have too much power, which makes it difficult to control, especially when your driving screws.  If you really need more power than these boys offer, then you're much better off with a corded drill anyways.Capacity is next in line for a cordless drill.  The last thing you want to worry about when drilling is worrying when the juice will run out and you'll have to wait an hour for it to recharge or if they charge has run out after a few days of not using them. If you do a lot of torque extensive drilling and driving, you're power will vary greatly. These big boys, however, will drive a whole bunch of lag bolts with enough juice to drill a bunch of holes.  If you feel they're getting weak, put them in the charger and within a few minutes they're fully charge and ready to get back to work.Yes, size does matter.  Holding a heavy tool, especially when you're already in an uncomfortable position slows down the job and invites injuries. These little boys are light, yet substantial in the hand with no fatigue.I used these bad boys to disassemble and reassemble my garage door and rails. I worked for hours driving bolts, screws and it was a pleasant experience. After several hours of work, I never had to recharge once.  At the end of the day, I was able to recharge two batteries in less than an hour. Of all my tools, this is one that I can't part with.Is this a perfect tool?  No, but pretty darn close.  The only flaw, if you can call it one, is that I get confused between forward and reverse directions of the switch.  I often forget which way I should push in the switch.  It would be more intuitive if it had a pole switch where pushing it means forward and pulling it means reverse. Also, having the switches next to the trigger is convenient, but it slightly limits your finger position.  Regardless, hitting it by accident isn't common and this tiny flaw is found on all cordless drills. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 21:55:31	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

26414610	As an owner of a small business, I am always looking for the best tools.  Makita tools have never let me down over the past 10 years of business.  This drill is no different.  The balance and weight are proportional to reduce fatigue while drilling.  Using the keyless chuck requires little hand torque to secure the bit, one of the best chucks I have ever used.  These batteries provide the power for both drills that I use and a flashlight with power to spare.  Recently, while building a deck using 3 deck and lag screws, I had to charge every 2-3 hours while rotating to another battery.  I couldn't have asked for any better performance.

26236097	I have two of these 890 series routers and wish I had more.  I started off with just a fixed base thinking I didn't need the plunge base and didn't have the money for it at the time.  Now I have this kit and the other with just the fixed base.  As for what I think of this kit, I'll take the managers' approach to this review (good, bad, good).For starters, the wrench for table top adjustment - AMAZING.  Even if you have another 890 series router, go spend the $30 on this tool.  It seems rather expensive at the time, but in the end will save you a lot of time, anguish, and skin on your knuckles.However, when this unit sits in the router table, as mentioned in other reviews, wood chips and sawdust get lodged inbetween the base and the motor, making it VERY difficult to remove to make the removal of the base from the table easier.  This is no longer an issue for me though since one of my routers is essentially a permanent fixture in my router table while I use this kit for any out of table routing I might have.Overall, the action is very smooth.  I have not had an issue with the plunge base as others have reported, however the plastic piece w/ the red line for the depth guage has been broken since day one and I have not had a chance to make it to the Porter Cable store to attend to the matter.I would definitely recommend this kit.  Remember - if you think you don't need the plunge base now, once you get better and more crafty with your router, you'll be kicking yourself for not getting both, because it's foolish to buy the plunge base after the fact because you end up spending more than necessary. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 21:59:01	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

41927038	I bought this dewalt bisquit joiner to replace the old Porter Cable model (which was (is) the worse tool I've ever purchased).  This DeWalt is the exact opposite.  Simple to operate and produces quick and effective slots for the bisquits.  The only detractor I could mention is the dust collection system is prone to clogging due to a small chute between the blade chamber and the collection bag.  Additionally, I've had some trouble getting precise orientation of the slots when using the angle fence.  Otherwise this is one of my favorite tools.  Ranks even higher than my routers.  I'd buy it again in a second. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:00:50	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
26019988	True I am addicted to Harbor Freight, but that's because if you know what you are checking out, their tools are quality. I had just bought a Porter Cable 2 in 1 nailer and when I saw the CP version in HF for half the price, I decided to try it. I built my friend's daughter's room when their baby was on it way - no problems. So I figured what the hell...worst thing is I have to return it. I bought this guy to help me repair/replace portions of a deteriorating front porch...hell, I not only replaced some of the floor planks but I redesigned and built a sturdier (more up to code) railing all around. My neighbors compliment on my work even though it was my first solo full rail. It worked beautifully. It is true as with some of the other CP nailers that the design is slightly bigger, sometimes it can spark and perhaps a tad heavier...but i think for the deep price difference, it is a minor issue at that. #1 - it nailed fine at an angle as long as you have the point as flushed as possible and slightly more umph #2 sparks are only from the nail fills that are held by a thin metal wire and lacquer - otherwise, the only lacquer held is fine #3 build some muscle...it ain't that much heaver for christ's sake. It's metal housing and rubber insert grips with a non-marring nylon front.PRO:- pretty decent build quality- back vent that rotated so you don't shoot air in your face and fall off the roof or something- loading slide is easy, has a lever to keep unused nail from just dropping out when your finished...slide down and push in a lever  and a shake will slide it out.- price- comes with an allen wrench, oil, manual and tethered cap to keep inlet dirt free- safety feature as all should need to push the front tip on surface to enable the trigger to engage and fireCons:- body is slightly wider than few on the market but not a deal breaker. I've seen other major brand with bodies just as wide or awkward-  after some usage..check the nail reservoir screws as the vibrations after all that usage may loosen it. Simple fix, I dabbed a tiny smear of blue locktite but it took repairing a medium sized front porch, side deck and other misc repairs for them to finally vibrate loose so this is a very nit picky point- non-marring tip can be slippery at angle shots but not a stick point either. I did see some nailer with a knurled tip for grip..maybe an upgrade for this if I can fine one but if you really need to I'm sure you can figure something - again - nit pick- perhaps it's only with HF nails, don't wait until the very last nail in reserve, it can jam. I usually keep a healthy reserve and it's smooth nailing all the way. No biggie.IMHO - my cons were a nit pick list. I really have no complaints so far and I've been rocking away all sorts of projects. Easy maintenance - just one drop of oil in the inlet before airing up. Otherwise, air puff the outside and a quick wipe. One of the best 60 bucks I saved...I obviously returned the porter cable since. Oh yea, if you buy from Harbor freight, don't forget your coupon and it'll be cheaper plus whatever freebie is for that month! 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:00:50	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
38311862	I got this little drill for light duty work. I don't like using my big heavy 18 volt BD when I just need to drill a few 1/8 inch holes, which is something that comes up a lot in my business. I was pleasantly surprised when I got it out of the box and tried it. This little drill can make 1/2 inch holes while barely slowing down and drives wood screws perfectly. I wouldn't go out and build a deck with it or anything, but it's nice to know that I can drive a screw with it if I need to and not worry about overloading it. I've seen a few negative reviews, particularly about chuck wobble. The wobble is barely noticeable, and once the bit starts into the work piece, it's stabilized and doesn't cause a problem. Someone else mentioned a problem with the gear shift switch. I would say that that reviewer had a defective unit and should exchange it. All in all, I couldn't be happier with this drill, it's my second Bosch tool (the other is a router) and it has turned me into a Bosch fan. The next time I need a new tool, I will definitely buy a Bosch. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:00:50	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

51585637	I purchased this drill along with a Makita BDF452 and gave both a workout in my garage. My test used 2x6 pressure treated lumber. My goal was to test power, battery endurance and comfort of use. With both drills, I drilled qty (10) 1 spade bit holes, qty (20) 3/8 bit holes and sunk qty (75) 2 drywall screws. My hand and arm were tired so I quit, but suffice it to say, neither drill quit, so I called battery endurance test a tie. I believe the Bosch had slightly more power and speed, but the Makita had plenty of both for my needs. Both drills gave your arm a good twist when the spade bit would catch and hold. In a close race, I declared the Bosch the winner in power category. The Makita was clearly a more comfortable drill to use. It fit my hand well and the trigger was easy to use. The Bosch handle is configured at a bit of an angle and while using the spade bit the back of the drill seemed to press into my hand. Also, during use my finger naturally moved to the bottom of the trigger and it became a bit uncomfortable. Both drills are very well built and neither got hot during my tests. At the end of the day I preferred the Makita because it was slightly smaller (about 3/4 shorter) and clearly had a more comfortable grip position during use. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:07:06	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

51211064	This is a fantastic tool, I have had it over a year but only use it occasionally. It's usefulness amazes me every time I use it.

43558756	I've owned this set for about 3 years now.  In that time, we've used the circular saw, drill, and reciprocating saw intermittently, but they always performed when we needed them.  All have performed phenomenally actually.  As for the light, we never use it.  Plugging in a $75 battery to the light just seems like overkill when you could be using the tools or charging the spare (and using a much cheaper light).The biggest problem, and the reason for the 4 star rating, is the batteries.  After only 2 years, one of the batteries decided to die... permanently.  It worked one day, and after I drained it from use I popped it on the charger and came back the next.  The charger had an error on it.  I tried again, same issue.  After getting confused, I Googled it and found this to be a common problem.  The batteries just die one day, and for me that day happened after I was out of warranty (as it seemed to for most people).  Apparently it has something to do with one cell failing, and the controller marking the whole battery dead.  Replacements are about $75 currently (for the full size battery), which is a major bummer because I love these tools.  Electronics is another hobby, so maybe some day I'll learn how to fix it...Otherwise, the tools themselves are GREAT.  They provide more than enough power for most jobs and have lights on them to see where you're cutting/drilling/etc.  They are built durably, and keep going.  Each has separate settings depending on the job you need to do.  The rapid charger allows you to be running one battery, and by the time you need the next, it's ready to go.  The only real downside I've found with the tools themselves is that I wish the drill had a level, but that was no deal killer.Don't get me wrong.  I definitely love these tools, and highly recommend them, but don't be surprised one day when your charger tells you the battery has bit the dust. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:08:33	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

49047379	Unit was delivered very quickly - 3 days through Amazon Prime,Set up was a breeze - the instructions were unconventionally crystal clear and easy to follow. Obviously written by someone with a good command of English.I set it up beside my desktop and it amplified the signal from our router located in the basement (so 2 floors up).I was curious to see if the signal would extend outside the house so I went outside and it I received a signal within a 10 ft radius of the house - not bad for a repeater.

38362550	It was hard to pass up all the deals on the comparable Makita drills but the Amazon negative reviews stayed me away. Not only am I pleased that I waited and got a screaming deal on these Bosch and I have had nothing but great experiences with both tools. Have used them a lot and LOVE the bag they came in as well for it is big enough for me to put my drimmel bag of tools in with the two drills. I read a few reviews here where people complained about not having a hard plastic case. Heck I have been doing carpentry for 35 years and had many of those metal and plastic cases gather dust in my garage.Plus as I am sure you have read already, the batteries are above average also. Have not had them long but they sure do pack a lot of power for their size. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:11:01	No Defect		Expert	No		false

54964077	From reading the good reviews this tool received, I thought the warnings of blade removal/insertion problems were probably from user lack of reading instructions or brute force.  I am a woman with over 20 years experience with power tools, I read and follow instructions carefully, and I do not force things to their breaking point.  However, after one use with this tool, instructions in hand (having been forewarned), I went to change the blade.  Though I followed instructions to the letter, I couldn't get the blade out.  Again and again I tried, not knowing what I was doing wrong.  The top plastic piece then broke right off leaving me in the middle of a job with no tool to finish.  This tool looks brand new; I had purchased it, used it once, then didn't need it again until after the store would take it back.  They really messed up on this one.  It doesn't matter how good it runs if you can't get a blade in and out. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:20:22	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

29430670	First things first: If you're a pro, or a serious woodworker looking for a tool to use every day- or even every week- this ain't the one. It doesn't have the muscle to drive 50 screws deep into wood, or to drill steel, or any of a dozen other things you might want a good cordless drill motor for.But that's not what I bought it for. I've got a good Makita 1/2 cordless, and a couple of corded drills for that. This was for my girlfriend, who needs a drill once in a blue moon, and would like an electric screw driver for regular tasks around the house. And for that kind of use, it's very good indeed.So if you're looking for a convenient drill for light duty use, the BD; 9.6v is not a bad choice. One hint: The wall wart charger takes a long time to bring the drill up to full charge, so if you're thinking of regular use, get the fast charger and a second battery. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:21:59	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

34456260	DeWalt has finally done what others have attempted. To make a multi-purpose router kit do both plunge and fixed base work. Both bases fit very snugly and are machined well. The motor is much quieter than a P-C. Although it initially came without the large-hole subbase, a quick call to DeWalt got the part shipped without any hassle.So far, I have used the fixed base to edge trim and template cut a cherry cradle. Cherry burns so easily, yet I can move the router quickly enough to cut with little burning and no chip-out.I would purchase this combo again. The initial ad I saw in a magazine does make it appear that you get D-handle base also. This is not the case, although it is available from DeWalt  ($$$, I believe). 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:21:59	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

55283780	I don't have problem with the equipment itself, it is perfect and I like it.Shipping was horrible, once I open the package there is a black insert inside the t-box which was broken from several places. Then there is a accessories box inside the t-box that was broken too.I didn't care much about that as long the equipment is in good conation and all the accessories are in the box. Maybe because of the weight this has happened and if Amazon won't fix this issue with their shipping some customer may return the item. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:21:59	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
54736756	This is a very interesting and fun screwdriver.  I've never seen one quite like it.  You will need to actually read the instructions to understand how to work it properly, but that takes all of 5 minutes.  DO NOT let it fully discharge or it will reduce battery life over time per Black  Decker.  I keep mine plugged in when not in use, so I cannot speak to how well it holds it's charge when not used for long periods.  So far, I'm very happy with my new neat little gadget. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:23:31	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
48655961	I have used the Paslode framing nailers for two years and had it in the shop three times and repaired it myself several other times.I have had to replace the rings twice and had to have the fan motor re-wired.  The tool  must be oiled before every use and during use if doing more than a couple  hours of work.  I would not recommend it for daily use or large jobs, only  occasional piecework.

44334303	The drill arrived in a box that appeared to have been handled roughly during shipping.  I was initially concerned.  However, the foam packaging did its job and all drill componenents were in brand-new condition.Assembly was easy and proceeded exactly as the manual specified.  All metal parts have a healthy dose of protective oil.  You can wipe the excess oil with a clean rag (but never actually wash or clean the oiled surfaces).The laser alignment process works as advertised thanks to the included alignment pin that fits into the drill chuck.  It is important (as another reviewer has mentioned) to align each laser parallel to the alignment pin.  Once each laser is parallel, you can adjust where they intersect for perfect alignment below the drill bit regardless of the height of the adjustable table.For the money, this is an excellent drill press.  I haven't used it extensively yet, but initial tests have been perfect. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:25:21	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

76157233	Just got this as a gift, and it's a blast. I had a B and D which was fine, but I lost the bit and it wasn't a common size, so I had to jam another in which was kind of wobbly. So the idea of having the bits stored internally, and to have them selected with a revolving cartridge is a big selling point for me.Like others mentioned, though, this is NOT a heavy duty driver, nor is it variable speed. Look elsewhere if that's what you want. But if you want a screwdriver to keep in the kitchen drawer for light duty stuff like assembling toys, etc., then this works great. The rotation speed is fast enough so it doesn't take forever but slow enough so you don't lose control. Variable speed would have been nice, but for just light duty screwing this works fine, and really makes those kinds of projects fun. I can't wait to put together something which requires changing out slotted for Phillips bits back and forth (my son's play kitchen last year would have been perfect for this tool). The cartridge mechanism has a satisfying resistance, and you truly will never lose another bit again. It's such a simple concept when you see how they did it. Why did it take so long for someone to figure this out?!?!The first thing I did was consolidate 6 of the more common bits into one cartridge. It really felt like I was loading some kind of weapon. I wish it came with a second, larger slotted bit, so I grabbed one from my tool box and it fit in and works perfectly with the cartridge mechanism. (An extra large slotted bit I had didn't fit, though). The SD also comes with a second cartridge, but that kind of defeats the point of the product in my opinion, so I just threw it (and the lesser used bits) in my junk drawer.Can't comment on battery life yet, since I just used it on a few projects.This has a good weight to it and feels sturdy and robust, but is otherwise pretty small. My hand slips off the handle, but I think they were going for compact here- again this is pretty light duty. Simple, clean design. The orange and black looks cool.Summary:Lacking options like variable speed and only suitable for light duty around-the-house tasks, but these shortcomings are more than compensated for by the fact that this things is so much fun to use AND you will never lose another bit again. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:25:21	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

The direction of the driver was impossible to control as was the speed.  It was awkward to even handle.  I went back and read the reviews and noted how many were 1 and for much the same as my experience.

26594208	This is a good tool for a casual weekend warrior needing to make a few minutes of cuts at a time, so the motor can cool down between uses.  It is not a major workhorse.  Now I'm only reaching for it when no other tools will do.  Of course for any tool, using sharp attachments is the way to go.  But just a little bit of use seems to dull attachments enough to make a noticeable difference on the motor's tendency to heat up, and of course, selling the pricey attachments is the business model.

I looked again at my BD cutting tool and it said it was for both wood and metal so I gave it a try.  I worked great under the cramped under sink conditions - cut quickly.  Tool swap out is a snap.

143516	If you are in the market for a new impact driver, please take a look at this tool.  First off, I am not a professional, I am an advanced DIY type and build most of the projects in my home, my brothers farm and volunteer.  I have owned this for about two months now.  I checked the review on a tool review site and figured I would try it out.  I have owned the following 18v Impact Drivers: Dewalt 18v XRP Lithium, Dewalt 20v (I know not an 18v) Lithium, Milwaukee M18 both compact and XC, Makita BTD 141, 142 and LXFD01 Brushless, Bosch 18v Lithium.  My least favorites were the Dewalts however they are quality tools, I am just not a big Dewalt fan.  I buy and sell tools to keep my woodshop well stocked so I come into contact with many tools.On to the driver...First off, this tool has a brushless motor which increses power and longevity. The tool is resplendant in heavy rubber overmold. The tool uses an optical trigger (seriously, this is a good thing, triggers go all the time).  The tool has 4 speeds!  You can adjust the amount of impacts to full time or just enought to get a fastener into the wood - Awesome! There is an LED Headlamp which you manually turn on and off and a battery gauge.  The tool has up to 1420 lbs of torque, 3200 BPMs and 2600 RPMs.  Honestly this tool is an incredible piece of equipment that will last a long time and more than perform.  Take the time to look over reviews and video reviews, you cannot go wrong with this impact gun. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:31:48	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

52094059	I have many of the Black  Decker 18v tools, this one included. I'm very impressed with the features available with this sander, particularly for the price. The only thing I would suggest is Black  Decker make it easier for folks to purchase accessories, such as a dust bag, by enclosing a list of available accessories with the sander in the box or by enabling customers to order them directly from Black  Decker's website. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:33:40	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

57738961	These are really high quality drivers that are clearly quite well designed.  They are perfect for people who have small hands and aren't building houses.  Drove a pound of 3 nails fastening 2x8 to 4x4 PT lumber and still had juice left over.  It's not the quickest impact driver out there, but what do you expect for a tiny 12V set?I just wish that Dewalt would add more tools to the 12V MAX line. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:34:26	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

29263283	I was looking for a small milling machine to repair clock works that I could mount on a bench.  This fit the bill.  It needed a set of collets though ($75) and I had to make a new draw bar because the one that comes with it is metric.

41035337	When I originally reviewed this drill, I was thinking that the evolving battery technology sort of left this one in the past. Well, now I have second thoughts. Having had the drill for well over 5 years, it's still going...and going...and going. The batteries--well, the original NiCads lasted me maybe 4 years, which isn't too shabby. But lately, I've seen that you can get NiMH 3 amp-hour batteries for this baby on Ebay at a very nice buy-it-now price.So, combine the new batteries with a drill that is fairly light weight, a huge range of speeds, and, as I said, just shows no signs of wearing out after 5 years and multiple tumbles off the workbench...All I can say is, Dewalt knows how to make a drill. The 400 in-lbs of torque comes in very handy for sinking lag screws deep into wood or for using Forstener bits. That's a lot of torque. You can get a bigger Dewalt drill, like the 14.4 or 18 v versions, but they weigh more (in the case of the 18 V, a LOT more).Some other alternatives: The Panasonics seem to be at the top of the heap with 3 to 3.5 amp-hours with their NiMH  battery packs, and Makita's lithium ion batteries on their 18 v unit have 3 amp-hours. The tiny Makita, recently out, has a 1.5 amp-hour battery that charges in 30 minutes, and is super lightweight. I own the 2 Makitas, and the smaller one is my prefereed (except when I need to hammer drill)--but I don't know yet if either will outlast this Dewalt. I've already had clutch problems with my larger Makita.In sum, if you want a durable, long-lasting, high-torque, very variable speed drill that doesn't weigh too much, this one may be hard to beat. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:35:51	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
33199720	However, it would be nice if internally there was a bit of a cyclonic deflector so the incoming grit didn't go straight into the filter but rather had a chance to settle out below it.If you've got spare M18 batteries this is a lot more convenient than hauling a shop vac around. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:35:51	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
22882323	To use the router compass you have to first drill holes slightly over sized and counter-sunk into it so you can attach it to your router.  IT DOES NOT COME PRE-DRILLED.  I would have never ordered this if I had know that.  Of course the lexan (polycarbonate resin thermoplastic) is only 1/4 thick so any attempt to counter-sink this will most-likely end in failure - there is no margin for error - leaving you with a worthless overpriced piece of plastic.  I should have returned it the second I pulled it out of the package.  Don't waste your time. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:35:51	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
41581241	For homeowner use this is the bomb! I own a corded Dremel tool but this is so much more convient. I learned about this tool at a friends house that I was working on.

34780138	Purchased this saw for $225 now it's $90??? Oops. Guess I should have studied what I was buying. The slide seems flimsy and not that sturdy. I have gotten satisfactory results from it, but VERY difficult to calibrate. Of course you will need to buy a replacement blade for fine work. At $90 it's a steal, don't forget to add in the price of a fine blade and a stabilizer...don't get me started.

57131980	I purchased this compressor for small tasks at home such as inflating bicycle tires, the air bags on the truck and to blow out the ATV air filter, and inflate air mattresses.  The first use was to inflate the air bags on the truck before hooking up the fifth wheel for a weekend camping trip.  All was fine no problems.  A few days later I was blowing out the ATV air filter and the compressor started to vibrate and bounce whereby shortly thereafter there was no air pressure.  I turned off the compressor and noticed a washer and a lock washer on the garage floor which came for the air compressor.  Unfortunately, the lowest rating that I can give this pathetic POS is 1 star otherwise it would be on the minus side.

36448776	I buy the best for my money.  I research for days, and pick the best tool for my application.  I am a serious DIY/rental owner and when my old magnesium-case porter cable 9987 bit the dust, it was time for something new.The Makita LXT got all of the best reviews, most power, best batteries, etc.  Makita, afterall, started as an electric motor manufacturer so I figured it had to be good.I purchased this drill, charged up the battery, and fired it up.  The specs dont lie...it does the job with power to spare...its relatively light weight and comfortable and pushes 3 screws with ease.if you want this drill to do the job, and do it well, go buy it and stop reading this.  If you want to have bought a nice piece of equipment for your money, go buy something else.First off, when you try to feather the motor it whines and you can tell there is a ton of resistance.  Basically it sounds like a cheap kids toy and has very poor motor control.  Trying to do anything technical or fragile will probably drive you nuts, strip a screw, etc.Secondly, like most others say, the chuck is not straight...it wobbles.  Try drilling a 3/16ths hole with a wobbly chuck and you'll quickly learn it doesnt turn out well.  I tried four home depots and all of their models wobbled to some degree.  This is fine for rough work, but for me, this is not acceptable for my money.Given those two concerns, i returned the item and went back to the drawing board.  I played with the DeWalts and realized the chuck wobbles just as much, so that was out.  I finally ended up with the Bosch.  On paper, this is not the strongest or lightest or best drill, but the build quality is excellent and for a remodeler not using this daily, it has handled two remodels and a deck with ease.  Also - the motor is a quality unit, and the chuck is perfectly straight...just like you should expect out of a $200 purchase.Sorry Makita - lost another customer. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:39:46	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
27013370	Same #34;adequate#34; design has been getting produced for some years now.  Clamp setup can't quite get to 90 degrees, requiring disassembly and grinding/modification right out of the box just to do a square crosscut.  The non-quick-release clamp is just.../crap/ - can't stand the idea of cranking that thing in and out many times a day -- I mean, it's not even Acme threads.  If I hate that clamp now because it's not QR, I'm going to loathe it later after it gets rustier and rustier.  There's just about nothing that's NOT going to rust here.

29112154	I like this tool, it is compact enough to fit in your pocket but delivers screw driving capability equal to most 12v full size drivers that I've used.  The light is a nice feature.  I found the small size to be very handy when driving pocket screws in a place that was a little tight.  It will work as a drill but the speed is too low to be very good for drilling.  If you have only one driver and you do much drilling I wouldn't pick this puppy but for the guy who drives a lot of screws it's great. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:41:49	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
42747234	And it is a light duty drill for the occasional user for needs around the home. I need a drill only a few times a year and when my quite old NiCad one died I got this. First for the brand name and second for Lithium ion battery. These have a very high current rating so even at 12 volts it produces a reasonably high torque.And to test that I attached a 2 3/4 dia. garden auger and as long as I took it slow it worked just fine, not for long but fine. Being retired I don't have to squeeze in all the garden work on a weekend so recharging and spreading the work over several days is not a problem. Recharging took about four hours.

38112280	The saw is great. It has all the power you will ever need for any wood or composite trim work. And I've used mine for very heavy work including cutting old and very dry 1 solid oak old barn floors. The stand is excellent for portable work. Although I will warn that the extensions aren't very tight, so don't count on them for a square cut. When folded the legs act as arms for a 2-person carry. Therein does lie one other criticism. It's a big large and akward for a single person. So consider a smaller saw without a stand if you work alone and have to carry it around. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:41:49	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

40864182	This tool is outstanding in tight spaces.  I've used it to install hold-downs in tight spaces, where a normal right-angle drill, including a low-profile cordless, simply won't fit.  The alternative is to use a hand socket drive, which if you're installing a bunch of these, will take 5 to 10 minutes per screw, and will leave you cursing, with chopped up fingers and hands.  It uses a fair amount of air, so if you're using a small air compressor, for example the compressor you usually use to drive a nail-gun, you'll find that the air pressure lasts only about 1/2 through driving the screw.  So you wait 30 seconds, then finish driving that screw.  It also doesn't spin very fast, so if you have the room to use a traditional right-angle drill, you'll still want to use that tool.  But at $30 or $40, this tool will pay for itself after just a few hold-downs. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:43:22	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

49642448	I can't say enough good things about this saw that haven't already been said by all the other 5 star reviews.  This saw is better than its DeWalt competition. I've used the DeWalt many times and the Bosch is a smoother cutting saw, quieter, and easier to use.  The fence is excellent and locks in place square to the blade every time.  There is much less vibration than other saws resulting in super clean cuts, good enough for fine finish work without a lot of extra sanding.  The Gravity rise stand is awesome! It is well worth it for any aging carpenter having to move a saw around. It will add years of life to your back for sure.I've had mine about a year and a half and it is holding up to job abuse extremely well.  I love this saw!  I got the saw on sale from a retailer and saved big money too.Makita has come out with a similar model saw and is bound to give the Bosch some competition but it is still over $600 at pro lumber yards and I didn't think it had as good of a stand. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 22:44:33	No Defect		Expert	No		false
22580894	I really like the soft start feature that totally eliminates the torque jerk when turning on. The up and down motion is not smooth at all. I find it takes quite a good force to start the plunge motion down and when it finally starts down you can smash the turning bit in too fast. I find that I have to use the knob in front to start the plunge to prevent this. Using the knob to start the plunge will prevent the jerk. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 22:44:33	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
46853354	Don't get me wrong - the drill is GREAT. The problem is the battery - if you don't use them on a regular basis, they lose their charge - forever. Milwaukee has a manual on how to jump start dead batteries, but it's a half-baked solution. The truth is, NiCad batteries from Milawaukee are seriously flawed for the occasional user. Probably great for a tradesman.I have a similar Porter Cable drill - the drill itself is junk compared to the Milwaukee. But, the batteries have lasted forever. Not sure what the difference is, but buyer beware. I'd suggest going to the Lithium Ion models. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 22:44:33	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

Then after one left me powerless at the start of a new project, I decided to buy this drill. Love it. It comes with 2 batteries. I do not use it daily, yet when I pull i out for a small project, it's always ready to go. Very powerful motor. Plus it has a small lite that shines on the screw head your working on. Glad I made this purchase even after reading some negative comments from old time Dewalt users. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:45:11	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
26751018	This is an absolutely awesome saw. Fantastic fence system, 24#34; rip capacity, and lots of power for being portable. Can't use a dado blade, but that's not a deal breaker. Plenty of ways to adjust for that. I am completely satisfied with this baby and definitely recommend it if you're in the market for a table saw 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:46:02	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

28929116	I was looking at multi-cutters for awhile, but was concerned after reading reviews that it was difficult to keep pressing the safety switch while cutting. After all, my objective was to make cutting easier, not more difficult, especially since I have small hands and tiny joints. However, I'd like to confirm another reviewer's comment that you can release the safety switch after engaging the trigger.I found videos on-line which made it look easy and showed how to operate the cutter, although it was not obvious how the safety switch was used.INSTRUCTIONS:If you're shopping around at the moment, you might not have the instructions handy so I'll to explain how the safety switch works. I'm right-handed, and this is how I get it started. I hold the multi-cutter in my right hand, press the safety switch with my left thumb, squeeze the trigger (right hand), then release the safety switch. Then to stop, release the trigger. It probably sounds more complicated in writing than it actually is.SMALL HANDS:I have small hands, but someone with hands larger than mine could probably operate the safety switch and trigger with the same hand. I have moderate strength, but it is easy to operate this cutter.WHAT I CUT SO FAR:So far I've cut terry cloth and t-shirts with ease. Stiff fabrics are easier to cut than soft fabrics, as you might expect due to the material stretching.It does a great job cutting cardboard. I've cut cardboard the thickness of Amazon boxes and the cut edge is smoother and straighter than I expected. However, I found that if the cardboard reaches a certain thickness and/or density, it takes a bit a little more effort to guide the cutter.It cuts nicely through clam shell packaging. Also, you don't need to worry about cutting through to the table surface as you would with box cutters.This cutter will spare my finger joints from excessive wear and tear. I prefer it to box cutters for straight cuts on most items. This is one of those items I wish I had years ago.PROS:- Effective cutting fabrics, cardboard and clam shell packaging- Simple to operate, even for my small hands and moderate strength- Saves your fingers from extra wear-and-tear- Price is right for the value this tool providesCONS:- NoneTIP:- You can release the safety switch once the trigger is engaged. This makes it easier to handle. Then to stop, release the trigger. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:46:02	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
57074118	I love this driver!  The clutch is very effective.  Once you get it adjusted for the density of the wood, it will drive screws to a consistent depth.  The half turn feature works quite well if you have a screw that doesn't countersink all the way due to a denser piece of wood.  Great battery life, this 12v will drive more screws faster than my 18v drill and is lightweight enough to use all day.  The built in flashlight is quite handy as well. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:46:02	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
24707662	Best bandsaw for the price. Easy setup, blade changeout and use. Bought for cutting bowl blanks and has the capacity of 12#34; without modifications. Works very well with the cutting sled.

These Li-Ion batteries last FOREVER!!!  And having a backup driver is almost SINFUL.  This combo replaces a 15yr old Makita Ni-Cad system...only because of battery obolesence.  Makita has never disappointed and continues to deliver.Be advised the charger is a GIGUNDOUS beast (apparently there's a memory chip in the batts that the charger uses to determine optimal usage and charge rates...sucker even has a cooling fan).  Consequently the hard case is a bit oversized...but do not let this deter from the performance.The LED lights are icing on the cake.  Even the belt clips have come in handy...who knew?For those that do their homework - Check the specs and you'll see this unit is superior to the competition.Nothing but love for Makita! 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:48:30	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

27177136	After using dowels to make one run of oak butcher-block countertop, I became frustrated with the quality of my joinery and the time required to clamp my little jig repeatedly.  For the second, more complex run I bought the PC biscuit joiner as a treat.  What a pleasure it is to use--good fit and finish, very easy adjustments, versatile...I used it vertically to cut biscuit slots for the backsplashes while the countertop was in place--something I couldn't do with my dowel jig.  The panels turned out nicely flat as well.  The dust port clogs when using the tool with oak--pine doesn't seem to create that problem--but it's a minor and probably irrelevant inconvenience compared with its overall tremendous ease of use.  Particularly for a beginner like me, this tool enables me to tackle more ambitious projects than I may have tried without lots of joinery experience.  No, you can't borrow mine! 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:49:50	No Defect		Novice	No		false
45394783	Just bought one of these tonight and couldn't be more pleased.  I've been repairing termite-damaged bathroom joists and subfloor in anticipation of screwing in backerboard for a tile floor.  Been using my trusty Makita cordless, which I thought was pretty good (although it's from circa '88 and the batteries aren't holding a charge like they used to).  And it's been a tough job because I've had to basically stand on my head to screw hangers on these new joists, working at arm's length half the time.  Knew I needed more power and read the comments here.  Right on, folks!  I just wish I had bought it earlier.  In shots where I struggled with the cordless, this bad boy just growls and drives in a screw at whatever speed I like.  Now I'm looking forward to finishing the job. I usually buy through Amazon because of their prices and service, but didn't have time tonight (I'm without a toilet until I get this done, okay).  The store had a comparable Milwaukee drill for about 20 bucks more and I know it's tough to beat Milwaukee.  What sold me on the DeWalt were the two spirit levels -- one for flat horizontal and one for straight down -- built right into the handle.  That's a feature I really could have used in the past (like putting in a mantle when I needed dead level holes for the support bolts).  The levels were the clincher, along with the fact that it comes with a case, although you do have to bend the cord just a tad to fit it in.  Both drills had keyless chucks, although the Milwaukee chuck was all-metal, a tempting feature since a tight spot kind of shredded my plastic Makita chuck earlier today.  Chuck slippage?  I haven't seen it it.  And I put plenty of torque to a couple of screws going through knots (what did happen to cheap, straight-grained lumber?).  I was kind of surprised that there was no ground on the plug - maybe insulation technology has progressed?  The handle feels sweet, with a big groove for thumb and forefinger lined up to put pressure on the bit; you use your little fingers for the trigger.  Great speed control with plenty of torque at a crawl.  Light weight for the power.  Just a lot of drill for this do-it-yourselfer's money. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:49:50	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
32533646	For what it counts I am a struggling self taught(with mistakes)garage woodworker who is space and financially challenged.  Overall this is a great little product for casual woodworking.  If you are a full timer using highend wood then you should probably spend some cash for highend machine.  I have used the joiner and planer with good results, now my friends keep showing up wanting me to machine their wood(from a tree).The reviews are correct, the users manual and the hardware you receive does not match...not to worry just look at the picture and hardware and you will figure it out.  Setting the planer out feed table is fun but doable, just leave the three attaching bolts loose before you use the two allen head screws to set the outfeed table a little higher at the outside edge.  The inside edge should be flush where it attaches. I spent more time adjusting everything than I did assembling it.  I did not have a coplanar issue as some have reported.  I did have to learn what coplanar was and no I feel like einstein.My only dislikes are the cheap plastic locks and that the back fence is not adjustable, just use a sacrifical fence so you are not always joining over the same area of the knives.  Hope this helps and enjoy. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:49:50	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

Compared to drills with the old-school NiCd batteries, this one is a run-away winner.  The drill is very strong for being only 7.2V (I've drilled through stucco and driven 3#34; wood screws just fine) yet it's compact and lightweight.

Don't you hate having to wait around for a big, strong someone - with just the right tool - to do a bit of simple screwing so you can have a dreamed of bookshelf or day bed assembled, or have an amazing bit of intricate grill work hung on a bare wall, or a tubular bird feeder screwed to the deck or fence?One could easily use a manual screwdriver, but that is soooo last century, tedious, strains the wrist and does not create that Wow effect, i.e. neighbor envy when used outside. :)  Ah, if only you had a streamlined tool that wasn't too heavy, yet had plenty of stamina for lots of impromptu projects!DEWALT DCF815S2 12-Volt Max 1/4-Inch Impact Driver Kit is Perfect for smaller hands.  Why should the guys have all the cool tools?  Modern, sleek, light weight with lots and lots of energy -- and does not tire the hand, like a larger unit would.  Can be used throughout the house and around the outside for numerous projects us ladies sometimes wait-and-wait-and-wait for a guy to get around to doing. 'nuf said!This 12Volt lithium Ion battery kit takes  inch hex accessories and 1 inch bit tips, includes a charger and 2-battery packs, has forward/reverse control, 3-LED work lights, and quick release chuck and a very handy carrying bag.I initially used this tool to unscrew several bar stools for storage. It's compact size made it easy for me to maneuver between the stool chair pegs to unscrew the seats from the stools. This tool is lightweight, and powerful. Its chuck release is easy and efficient. This is great tool for a multitude of applications.DEWALT DCF815S2 12-Volt Max 1/4-Inch Impact Driver Kit goes where you go -- just charge the long lasting battery pack and begin to get all those projects you've been putting off done.A Pleasure to use, instant results!

52310642	I just received mine, and I'm returning it.  It seems the quality of the reconditioning is hit or miss for us.  I paid $104.49 for it on March 26,2011.  It arrived filthy, one gauge defective, and the whole thing came apart as I lifted it out of the box.  Was this some kind of joke?  My bet is the issue was really poor quality control.

23969492	This is a very sturdy vacuum. Rather like you would expect a wet/dry vac to be built,although it admittedly comes at a fairly steep price. Overall, if it lasts 10 years or more (which I would expect), it will be a good buy in the long run. It's a smidge quieter than the cheaper (Home Depot/Lowes) models, but again MUCH better build quality. The hose that comes standard is the only flimsy part that I notice. It's pretty thin and tends to kink quite easily. The BIG oddity with this vac is that it comes with NO attachments. They will run you over $100 for a kit or all sorts of normally standard items.

There is a mismatch between the chuck and the 1/2 inch chisel bit combo.  Jet disclosed to me, after I could not insert the 1/2 inch bit as far into the chuck as was necessry to work with the chisel, that there is a mismatch between the bits and the chucks, and some machines got the wrong chuck for the bit.  Very unfortunately, they offered me no fix, other than to cut down the drill shank enough that it would fit in the chuck and not stick out of the chisel.

45887742	I am a plumber and am used to cutting my PVC pipe w/ a good o'l cordless Sawzaw.  Thought I'd give this tool a shot to save me from cleaning up the shavings and cutting perfectly straight.  I just used the tool for the second time on a repair and the tool cut great on the first cut but on the second cut it basically shattered the 2 PVC Foam Core. Mind you I was in a tight place on the second cut and couldn't give the tool a little twist as I was beginning the cut. Ended up using the Sawzaw to clean up the mess. Also, the safety is cumbersome especially when switching from cut to retract which mind you does not happen automatically.  You must power the shear open for a sec. before you can hit the quick release lever. It's probably good that the safety is a pain, otherwise the tool would be very dangerous.  But if you did start to cut into an appendage, you would have to switch it to reverse, push the safety, then drop the tool and call 911.  I think I would like the tool better if it defaulted to the open position at all times when you release the trigger. I would give it all five stars if it didn't shatter my PVC pipe.  Other than that it does cut a perfectly clean and straight cut so maybe use it when roughing in or when shattering pipe isn't such a problem like in a repair situation were you kinda need to be left with some usable pipe to make the connections proper. 	winp0007	10-25-2015 22:55:54	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

Like most reviewers, I found the 2-speed option mostly trivial and just leave it on the 90 cpi setting.  The manual is quite good (as most Delta manuals are) and I was cutting wood within an hour of bringing it home.

24125021	I purchased this item for my husband, for his Birthday, he had been telling me for a year or so that this is the Miter Saw he really would like to have. I kept looking at different places and finally decided onAmazon.com, because the price was within my budget. We are beginning to do some remodel work in our home and this will be utilized a lot.

51800581	I was skeptical about this gun having enough power to do what I needed, but I just put my fears to rest after testing it. First of all, it's so simple to load and use, you could probably do everything without reading the directions. But read them anyway.I loaded some Arrow staples into the gun (they weren't on the approved list, but they fit and work well), turned it up high and shot a staple into a 2x4. Went in with gusto and flush to the wood (3/8#34; staples). I turned the power down halfway and couldn't tell any difference. Flush into the wood. I consider this product a bargain at less than $30. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:00:00	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false

52851867	I bought this sander for sanding my hardwood floors.  I choose to get this sander, because, I did not have to time to rent a big sander and finish it all at once. I have used it for sanding around 500 sq.ft of wood flooring in my house.  This sander is pretty powerful, precise in its tracking and quality build. I used makita 40 grit,then wood filler to seal holes, then 80 grit, and finally 120 grit before staining it and finishing it off with Minwax polyurethane coatings. Each belt sands around 10 sq.ft before wearing out.The machine is reliable as japanese cars, kind of bullet proof. You will need knee pads for sanding floors. after the first day of sanding the body feels like... after a first time gym workout, its cool after that. Overall I am satisfied as it precise on the edges near floorboards and fine finish, as it is not heavy as - drum sanders that gouge floors if you are using it for the first time. The dust is managed well by the dust bag. Good product from Makita! 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:00:55	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

46402917	Works like a charm on smaller pieces of wood, etc.. approximately 2 inches high or lower.  Cross cutting not big enough for 2X4 but works for straight cuts.  Laser is slightly inaccurate and it is very difficult to set angles.  I had to paint the angle numbers in silver color to able to read from a distance.  Has a strong motor that is very smooth.

I felt of the motor and it was so hot you couldn't leave your hand on it. I turned it off and waited till it cooled down and turned it back on. It only had the top speed .

55989885	I am not a carpenter or woodworker but am a bit handy around the house and this saw is perfect for me. Great for occasional work and light duty cutting.Let me cover a few points.First off it has good heft to it. Thats a big thing for me. You can often tell the quality of a power tool by its weight and this one has good weight. It is solid in your hands.Secondly it has a quick changer for the saw blades which is a big plus. You just turn and pop the old blade out and then push the new blade right in. This is a great feature and I really like it.Right out of the box I inserted the battery and ran off ten cuts of 2x3's and it was sharp, fast and neat with no stalling or issues with power. I am thinking the lithium ion battery technology is probably pretty good.Two speeds and a locking position. Which is really nice. I like how it doesn't have one of those buttons you have to press in order to pull the trigger. Just move it out of lock position and it is ready to trigger.Plus: It comes with a very nice cloth bag for storage and quick carrying.Overall it is a very nice saw, probably just for occasional to medium use and simpler projects because it is battery operated. But who knows, maybe it can take some heavier duty use. I am very happy with it.I also included a picture of that blade quick release. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:07:15	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

53910740	I have been a remodel contractor for 30+ years .  I recently bought the Bosch MX25EK which is so-so in my opinion.  It is underpowered for a contractor except for occasional use.  The cost of the blades far exceeds their value and they wear out quickly often lasting only one or two cuts.  At $10+ for blades, use a reciprocating saw when you can. Sometimes, the size and action of the Bosch makes it worthwhile for those hard to get to places.  A handpowered, undercut saw, works faster for door trim.  It works well as a detail sander.  If you think you are going to be using it a lot, either buy a Fein, or the more expensive, heavy duty Bosch. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:12:15	No Defect		Novice	No		false

44180337	I was a little skeptical about what this tool would look like for 26 bucks and change! But I must say after using it on  a job, that it performs as well as the expensive ones! We'll have to wait and see about the longevity, but at that price you could buy 3 or 4 replacements! The only changes I would make is on the battery and swivel. I wish it could have a lock on it so when you put it in your tool belt that it would stay facing forward,and it is also kind of hard to get the battery to release from the tool unless you have a very large hand! otherwise it's a great tool for the money. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:12:25	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

I recently started pricing a 4 piece 18 volt set for about 499 bucks...then I saw this 6 piece set for the same price and didn't hesitate a minute to purchase this item.  The price was the cheapest I've found.  Easily beat Home Depot and other home improvement stores by 50 bucks, plus no shipping or tax.  Used this set to hang drywall in my garage, frame up a treehouse, work on a couple projects for some family members, and other projects with no problems at all.

60000183	At first I was ready to return this saw to the local store where I bought it, and to phone Black  Decker, yet hoped I'd find a way to 'work' this saw, because I liked the possibility of an inexpensive tool for straight cuts in 4' x 8' sheets (of laminated wood). I tried everything, until finally I came to the right combination of tools for getting the most precise, straight cuts and square boards. I won't bore you with my failures, starting with using the saw free-hand, alone, without any aids ( just wouldn't recommend it). (For the 'short version,' the last step #8 is key):1. choose a good, sharp blade, with a large number of tpi (teeth) for a fine cut2. use a T-square  keep a perfectly sharp pencil to draw precise cut lines, keeping your pencil at the same precise angle for the full length of drawing the line3. use a machinist square as a guide for placement of your t-square when drawing cut lines for cuts that are perpendicular to initial cuts, (to ensure you end up with a 'square' board, in case your large board is not perfectly square  sliding the t-square along the edge will not give lines to produce a square board)4. set your (unplugged) saw on the 'waste side' of your penciled cut line on the edge of the board, to determine the margin from the saw blade to the outer edge of the saw's heel plate. Mark the very edge of your wood (which is the most precise point) to indicate the outer edge of the heel plate5. use a t-square to draw a second line exactly parallel to your 'cut line,' using the mark made in step #4. This 'heel plate line' indicates the margin needed for the heel plate of the saw6. use a transparent ruler, and run it along your cut line  heel plate line, (while keeping the ruler perfectly perpendicular to these two lines )to ensure the distance between these two lines is constant for the full length of the lines7. attach a straight edge to your board, lining it up with utmost precision, along your 'heel plate line'; this straight edge will guide the saw for the full length of the cut; (I purchased a 'contractor' straight edge, with a nice built in clamp at Menards). I'd also recommend double checking accuracy, by placing your saw back up on the edge of the wood, resting against the straight edge, to double check a precise position before starting to cut. Also, fyi... Just because this saw has the straight edge guide on the bottom does not rule out use of a straight edge. Most jig saws like to turn alot, but the combination of the saw's straight edge guide, plus having a straight edge clamped on your board, combined, makes your setup 'solid' for the production of straight cuts.***8. I found this step to be an absolute key to long straight cuts in sheet wood, because despite all of the above steps, my saw still veered off the course of my 'cut line,' jamming against the clamped straight edge, and forcing me to change the saw's setting to free cuts in the middle of the cut  quit using the bottom 'straight edge guide.' Once I realized a simple trick, I got perfect, precise cuts. At first I followed Black  Decker instructions in the manual, to make sure the straight cut guide on the saw's bottom looked aligned, by simply trying to sight it by eye. I finally discovered, this was the whole source of the problems I was having in getting straight cuts. The key to straight cuts is to ensure precise/ perfect alignment of the saw's bottom straight edge guide. Take a combination square (or small t square) and use that to ensure that the (unplugged) saw's bottom straight edge guide is perfectly aligned with the saw blade before each and every cut. Sighting it by eye creates inaccuracies. I take the combination square, and set the ridge of the square at the top- front edge of the (unplugged) saw's heel plate. I gently (without bending the saw blade in the slightest) place the straight ruler edge of the combination square against the blade, and finally, move/adjust the saw's bottom straight edge guide, by pushing it against the combination square straight edge ruler, so the saw's straight edge guide plate is perfectly in line with the saw blade; perfect alignment is indicated when both the saw blade and the saw's bottom straight edge guide both sit perfectly flush against the ruler of the combination square, without any gaps whatsoever anywhere for the full length of the saw's bottom straight edge guide. I then remove the combination square, and then gently place it on the saw again to double check for final alignment. (I'd add it also can't hurt to make sure your blade is perfectly straight, as I also ran into that problem. Just lay the blade on a perfectly flat table top, and examine if from both sides to make sure there are no gaps to indicate bends. I was able to bend mine into back into shape to get it perfectly flat and straight again). (Also, for very long cuts, I recommend stopping the saw after going a short distance, and adding a clamp to the gap created by the cut before proceeding all of the way, to keep the cut half of the board level while finishing the cut).Following all of these steps with care and accuracy, I have now consistently had perfect, straight cuts, as this saw promises (and I would add that I also always use the 'continuous' operation mode, so that I do not have to keep the trigger pressed, and can then better focus on keeping the saw held firmly and squarely against the straight edge, and watching the cut in progress).I had thought I'd need to buy a table saw for future projects, only out of a need for greater precision than my current project required, (since I am not a contractor, and do not need to rip off a ton of boards in seconds, and do not use the tool everyday. I can handle a slightly slower, but accurate cut with this jig saw and straight edge system). But now I find I get perfect cuts without urgently needing a table saw. Good news! (I also found the Dremel mini saw attachment worked great, but it will only cut 1/4 deep).Now, I think these are the kind of useful instructions Black and Decker should provide with the saw. It would save people a lot of headaches and trial and error, and avoid people returning this product, as I was ready to do at first, disappointed, when it is actually a great product so far (I've cut about 20 small boards so far, off a 4'x8'). Maybe an employee in the United States who actually uses the tool could write the instruction booklet, since the booklet is currently the biggest flaw of this tool in my opinion.Lastly, I came back to add, there were situations where I could not clamp down a straight edge (on a very long board), for some shorter cuts, and after following step 8, and making sure the bottom straight edge guide of the saw is perfectly aligned with the blade, I was able to make nice straight cuts free hand, without a straight edge, using the continuous mode, and going slowly, and the tool did a decent job of keeping the cut line cleaned of debris. For longer cuts though, I definitely consider the use of a clamped straight edge to be prudent.I really like the saw so far. Time will tell its durability. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:12:25	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

32089221	Bought this drill while I was rewiring several rooms in my house. Got it to drill through floor joists, and it did just that very well. Compact size with good power.The handle/trigger is tricky, and I unplug it before changing bits or if I'm done using it for awhile. Otherwise you're likely to activate the drill accidentally. Did it once, luckily didn't get hurt.But, the length of the trigger is good for one thing. With 2 x 10 joists, I was able to get the drill bit up into the upper part of the joist without having to stick my hand all the way up there. No keyless chuck, but that may be why it's compact. Keyless chucks are about 2-3 times as long as a keyed chuck, so for size issues, I don't mind it here. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:13:51	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

25333947	Yup, another high quality/high priced tool accessory from Festool.  If you do much edge routering with a Festool router, you need this to make the router more stable when it is hanging over the edge of the workpiece.  You could make your own, but this one is perfectly flat, smooth, and helps with dust collection.  Fits OF 1400 EQ. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:15:39	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
47149858	bought 2 units , worked great 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:15:39	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
37008935	The drill works great.  The battery holds its charge for a long time between uses.  I like all the extra bits and tools held in the case.  The case doesn't hold the drill very well... I had to leave the extra cardboard packing material in.  Maybe that's so you can re-use the case with another drill some day.  I haven't had it very long and I only use it for occasional household tasks, so I can't speak to it's durability. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:16:31	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
49943980	I too use this tool to remove ceramic floor tile from concrete floors. It gets the job done a little faster than a smaller one. After a while, you will have to sharpen it but that holds true with many tools if you are really  hard on the edge. I recommend this handy tool. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:16:31	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
58200533	He is very happy with it. Most of his tools seem to end up at Son's house. I guess we should ask him. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:16:31	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
60428112	This is a great combo for those that need a high quality cordless set. It has lived up to everything that I expected of it. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:16:31	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
26495341	Perfect size and strength, portable and comfortable as well. Super strong and versatile. The grip is very comfy and torque is amazing. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:16:31	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
56589634	Bought these to polish a single piece of granite I had.  They worked great but were fairly worn out after use.  I dry polished so they'd probably last a lot longer if you wet polished.  Overall I'm satisfied with the quality and the value. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:16:50	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
28492056	bought a month ago and i liked the torque and weight of the drill and the light was very good but a after a month of lite use (putting up drywall and drilling screws into lumber) it quit working all the time. gonna take back to lowes and hopefully get my money back and by a dewalt... 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:16:50	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
32529923	Ended up purchasing this item as I needed a mobile rattle gun and already own several other Hitachi tools/batteries which have performed beautifully.  This wrench is advertised as producing 160 ft/lbs of torque.  At first use, the gun seems to be a little on the weak side.  I torqued the lugs on my truck to 80ft/lbs and the gun initially took several seconds to work them loose.  Well, fast forward 2 days of moderate use and the gun just rips the lugs off now.  As someone else said in their review, the brushes need to settle before you'll see full power.This isn't the most powerful battery-operated impact wrench on the market but it's pretty much the best power per dollar fee.  I would highly recommend this gun if you're in the market for a portable rattle gun but keep in mind that 160ft/lbs isn't really all that much especially for rusted bolts and it can't compete with corded or air-powered wrenches. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:16:50	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
26003960	It may not be perfect, but it's a very handy combo pack of tools. The more I use them, the more I like them. They're not as bulky and heavy or as powerful as my other cordless drills. Most jobs I have done with drills don't need that much power so it's my first choice in tools. If it's not powerful enough then I fall back to one of my other drills. Great impact driver/drill combo for light to medium jobs. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:16:50	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
59104698	But it has worked great.  I've used one or two DeWalt tools before, and these are no exception - they are great quality, well balanced, and work great. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:16:50	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
26007861	So I bought this thing mainly for cleaning out my snake cage. I used it twice before it just quit sucking. No idea what is wrong with it. It does not appear to be jammed or anything. Now it just sits in the corner until I decide if I want to fix it or just throw it out. Don't go the cheap route and get this one. If you can't afford a better one than save up! 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:18:26	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
26470751	Nice drill.  My only complaints are there's no torque adjustment and it did'nt come with a bit as advertised.  As a refurb it was a bit scuffed but no big deal. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:18:26	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
34904454	As soon as I turned it on the blade tension knob and the upper blade holder hit the support case.The working beam is stamped sheet metal and the supporting case supplies very little rigidity and support.The hold down foot is worse than useless.It is obvious that this is a generic piece of junk branded for Rockwell, I have seen the same product with other branding.I returned it.DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!! 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:18:26	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
36773962	Not a Cadillac, but you are not paying for one either.  A great daily use nailer at a great value. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:18:26	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
22275143	My husband just had to have this to wax our cars regularly. That was 2 years ago. He waxed m y car, his truck and this tool has not seen the light of day since! But it did work fine, so he said. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:18:26	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
56274983	Works better than I expected!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thoroughly  cleans just about ANY surface!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  More than I was counting on. Recommend highly it. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:18:34	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
51175089	I am a crafter and used this to refinish my kitchen table, it worked really well and my kitchen table looks fantastic now! This is perfect for an occasional user. I didn't use it for anything heavy, but I am really satisfied. It is easy to get replacement heads at HomeDepot or Lowes, etc. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:18:34	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
39870402	Love them both. Used them when I built a privacy fence. Worked just advertised. I would recommend the set to anyone who needs a great drill set. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:18:34	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
34240547	Other than needing a second battery, this is an easy tool to use and no cord to get in the way! 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:18:34	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
39828199	Great for when you want to roll your saw out of the garage so dust isn't everywhere.  Well made, sturdy.  Good height. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:18:34	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
35877243	The saw is solid, light and the fence alignment is neat ... set it up at the site and you can just go for it.  I do a lot of detail work, nothing on the crazy scale, so from the the start, the saw delivered.  As you can tell, weight and fence are the most important to me, plus it has good power for every day work. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:19:46	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
46774356	Don't know why I waited so long to buy this tool. Works great for cutting out all things behind sheetrock. Only negatives are, its a little heavy for one hand operation and battery doesn't last that long. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:19:46	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
35764541	This is the best framing nailer on the market. Ive used most contracter grade guns out there and find the nr83aa3 to be the most dependable, cost efficient, and powerful gun for the money. I couldnt beat Amazons pricing either. Hitachi doesnt try to #34;promote#34; their products down your throat like the others do which, to me,  is the first sign of a quality product. I try to buy American whenever possible however this gun helps me save money by not having to replace them after a year of moderate use. Do your own research but this is a quality product. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:19:46	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
26349722	It took so long to figure out how to install the blade, 2 hours on Sat + 1 hr on Sun!  I haven't had a chance to use it, yet!  I hope it's worth the trouble, and thank goodness for Amazon's reviews that told me how to adjust the screw!  I will wait until Monday to try it and hope it will work like others said. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:19:46	No Defect		Novice	No		false

27881192	I purchased the Makita to replace and old jig saw that saw better days.  I researched this product online and found many favorable reviews.  Made in the UK.  Really like the light and the cord length is great.  Plastic case should protect the saw for many years to come. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:20:26	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
33361786	Save your money, don't even think about this for dust collection in your shop. My shop vac does a better job than this thing. I'm going to throw mine away it's such a big piece of junk. Dayton should send out letters of apology to anyone who bought this.Pat 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:20:26	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
27442754	I agree with some of the other reviewers that this isn't up to much as a drill, but it was just what I needed in an electric screwdriver and I wasn't looking for another drill. It feels good in the hand, the buttons are intuitive to use, it comes with some decent driver heads, and the LED light is awesome for dark closets. I keep the clutch on a fairly high setting for removing old screws otherwise it gives up rather sooner than I would like, but all in all, a great buy. I give four stars instead of five because the tape measure isn't there (the symbol indicating that there is one is on the handle, but perhaps I bought a model that doesn't have one.) 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:20:26	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
58387864	This was my first framing nailer, and I lucked out with a good one.  It can get right between studs on a 16quot; OC.  I have never had a problem with it.  The gun is powerful -no problems sinking nails. - Comfortable and well balanced.  It is a little loud and has some recoil, although not as much as my full-head nailor.  No jams so far.  The light weight won't wear you out either.  I don't think you can go wrong with this gun. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:20:26	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
49927844	Bought this at the local home center, almost completely based on feel. I have big hands, but still the barrel of most grinders is too big to hold comfortably with one hand. This one is different... the barrel is smaller in diameter, giving an easier one-handed grip, and likely also safer using it this way as well. My first Makita, tool. Very impressed with the build quality so far.This is listed as a 4 grinder, but if you take the wheel guard off, I imagine you could use 4.5 attachments on it. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:20:26	No Defect		Novice	No		false
57228269	I have had one of these set's for years, now bear in mind that the batteries will go bad after a while,and you must get them into the charger correctly, still I carry one of these set's with me always...I have driven 1/4 X 8 Trox Bolts and sunk them into pine, with the impact driver, and the drill I have shot 1/8th holes in sheet metal all day long...I bought my first set new at Carpinteria Valley Lumber Co. for $200.00 and have had it for 4 years now, it is still running Strong,and I bought my second set here on Amazon for $58.00...For what it is, it's a Great Set...The New 12.8 volt set's do have more power, and other perks, but if you have a choice between a blackdecker; pecker wrecker or this Makita Drill and Driver set in it's neat little case, I say choose The Makita...You will be glad you did... 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:23:08	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
53747597	I bought this compressor because my small engine repair shop runs on solarelectricity and my big compressor uses way to much power. The savings have been considerable, I believe that this little compressor uses about half the power that my 20 year old compressor uses. I run this little compressor every day for 8-10 Hrs. So far so good, I am very impressed with its performance. I am also running the air for about 100' under ground through 1 PVC from the inverter to the shop. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:23:08	No Defect		Expert	No		false
30483331	Works great, just what I wanted. Wished that changing from vertical to horizonal was provided by pushing a knob or moving a lever. Otherwise very good workmanship. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:23:08	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
38362550	It was hard to pass up all the deals on the comparable Makita drills but the Amazon negative reviews stayed me away. Not only am I pleased that I waited and got a screaming deal on these Bosch and I have had nothing but great experiences with both tools. Have used them a lot and LOVE the bag they came in as well for it is big enough for me to put my drimmel bag of tools in with the two drills. I read a few reviews here where people complained about not having a hard plastic case. Heck I have been doing carpentry for 35 years and had many of those metal and plastic cases gather dust in my garage.Plus as I am sure you have read already, the batteries are above average also. Have not had them long but they sure do pack a lot of power for their size. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:23:08	No Defect		Expert	No		false
48132780	That famous blade locking feature does not hold up the even the slightest vibrations. I almost damaged a counter top trying to cut a straight line, the blade came undone at every speed over the number quot;1quot; setting, which is the slowest, seven MAX being the highest. Get the manual locking models. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:23:08	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
57715285	I am a homeowner who yearned for new base boards and crown molding.Its very powerful, and I have other Dewalt tools that use the same battery so it kept going and going.  A setting of 3 or 4 (out of 10) was plenty to counter sink the nail (2 1/2 inch) into the wood molding.  I have finished 2 rooms with no jams or misfires.  If you are used to an air nailer it might be a bit heavier but they compensate for the weight by balancing the load nicely. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:26:23	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
45843350	It was everything I expected and more, Great tool! . I use it for my job everyday very dependable and portable. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:26:23	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
36515151	As I stare at my box full of old cordless drills and their depleted NiCad batteries, I can only wish that this drill was available much earlier. After retiring my DeWalts and Makita's and realizing that there is no shame in using an extension cord, I vowed never to throw money away again at a cordless and their overpriced NiCad batteries.Forced into a job site with no power, I purchased this drill from Amazon at a good price and put it through its paces with a variety of drill loads. Some specifics:1) The first impression has to be its small size, weight, quality of feel, balance. Obvious quality of materials and manufacturing.2)The chuck has to be the best that I have ever used. Easiest to change bits, extremely tight grip on both small (1/16) and large bits. Outstanding engineering concept and achievement.3) Speed control has two ranges and mesh perfectly from slow driver speed to fast drilling. Excellent trigger feel and response.4) And now the power. Don't even think of stalling this brute. The 3.5AH NiMH batteries have incredible reserve and recharge capablity. The charger is well designed and will quickly charge a depleted battery. These batteries seem to last all day.If you are thinking of a (the) top quality cordless drill that will last for many years and handle any job, this is the obvious choice. Well worth the cost, which is price competitive with the other 15-18v drill selections.You deserve this !! 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:26:23	No Defect		Expert	No		false
28154974	I have purchased 2 of these units over the past half dozen years.  When they work they are very convenient as you can carry the small remote in the pocket of your apron and it works from anywhere in the shop.  Both lasted for a few years and failed for no apparant cause.These units receive very infrequent use and are not overloaded in any way.  They were both used on a Delta dust collector.  I discussed the failure of the first one with PSI and was told since it lasted a few years it would be out of warranty and the unit was not repairable and no service information is available.  I purchased a second unit and it worked very well right out of the box.  Since I now had the old unit and a new unit I programmed the old remote on the new unit and it worked well.  This showed that both remotes work.  I then tried to program both remotes on the old power unit and neither worked.  This showed the problem was in the power switch of the first unit.  I have a whole house surge protector and have had no failures on any other electronic equipment so I don't believe that the input power is dirty and causing the failures.  My experience is that this product is simply unreliable and I can not recommend it. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:26:23	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

59727654	I don't think they make this model, anymore. Mine says made in Switzerland on it. It's been over 6 years, later, and this saw is great. The blade ejects and inserts, easily. It cuts beautifully, with almost no vibration.Bosch jigsaw blades are fantastic. With the right blade, this saw will crosscut maple and leave a shiny smooth finish that looks like it's been sanded an polished. Too bad it's so hard to cut a perfectly straight edge with a jigsaw.My saw tends to cut a bit off line. I know most jigsaws do. I wish there were a way to adjust the blade/shoe orientation on a jigsaw to allow for correction. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:27:41	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

34624835	Very, very nice little sander. Durable, doesn't seem to overheat during long uses, and works like a charm. And you get very cheap sanding discs on Amazon#8212;no more cutting and clamping regular sand paper to try to save some money, just get'em online before you need them and avoid the higher prices of hook and loop pads at the local improvement store. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:27:41	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

45919516	I built a pergola and decided to shape the ends of the rafters  my old jigsaw made a mess of the first attempt, in addition I had ro rig up a light to see the cut line and continually blow the saw dust away.The Makita has a built in light, motor air discharge takes care of the dust and the cuts are perfect.  Excellent product 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:27:41	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
47604642	I was surprised/disappointed to learn that the sander is an oscillating sander rather than a random orbital sander.  I had thought about taking the plunge for a Fein RAS (expensive) and thought that this was a great opportunity to get one along with the other gadgets.  I was wrong.  The pad must be completely on the work piece of the disc will dislodge and actually cause damage to the pad.  NOT a woodworkers sander! 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:32:19	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false

36611925	This tool makes changing a battery with side post very easy. I gave 4 stars rather than 5 stars because OTC's name is not on this tool. This makes it look cheep. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:32:19	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
34729955	Recently found a slick deal on this drill and had wanted a Lithium-Ion with a little more grunt then my BD firestorm (it recently found difficult times drilling through angle iron).  This drill really is a good performer at the price.  I would compare the quality to that of Dewalt so far.  I didn't have the chuck issues the other reviewer had.  At the same time I ended up buying the 7-piece compact set.  The tools in that are slightly lower quality but again, very high.  No issues with them.  The lifetime battery replacement is what really sold me!  It is a little sketchy though on the terms... need original proof of purchase and can change terms of the program at any time.  I also registered each part as 1-piece for the warranty within the 90 day period. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:32:19	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
61257056	I got this drill from Lowe's for $35.00.  It is about the same price at other places.  Why is the advertisement here saying it is in the $150 range normally and that they are saving you $113?  Also, you have to add in the (sometimes really steep) price of shipping!  Something smells here! 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:35:45	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

27706735	Beware.  They send faulty equipment and then expect you to fix it yourself at your own expense.  The shut off switch stopped working after just one hour of use.  They sent us a new part, but it's complicated to switch, and you have to have the right tools, which we don't.  We paid thousands for a brand new item, and received a faulty item with no support to fix it.  We are considering sending it back for a refund.  Very disappointing. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:35:45	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
51496981	I bought this saw from another vendor a year ago it was a floor model so I was able to check it out real good and it worked great for me.Then it got stolen.I liked it well enough to Buy it again and ordered it from Amazon. When it arrived I checked every thing out real well and found the laser to be out of alignment and the subfence was not lined up with the fixed fence .Rather than return it I called Hitachi .They told me the sub fence was bent and they would send me another one. After a week I received the wrong part. I called Hitachi again giving them the part number this time.0ne week later again ,wrong part again can't even figure out if this part even goes on this saw.So back to Amazon for an exchange ,new saw comes with new problem.Fence is broken (cracked off).Hitachi is garbage , no quality control. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:37:33	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
54269346	I bought this Mini-Mill to do small gunsmithing work. So far it has worked well. It was easy to set up and the manual is pretty easy to understand.

33547001	Great price, Great tool. Presently laying over 1600 sq.ft of 3/4 Bazilian Walnut(Very Hard Wood) and this tool works flawlessly. I have never bought tools over the internet and relied on several of the reviews to help me in my decision.

43987801	Wonderfull machine.Never experienced a more acurate and easy to adjust fence system.Going on 6 months of constant use and have had no trouble with anything.The only irritating things...difficult to connect the vacuum hose to the dust port and the motor arbor needs to be about an eigth inch longer to acomodate the dado blades I would like to use.No big deal. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:40:00	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

40485403	I purchased this item from Amazon and paid far less than anything from the Big box stores. The stapler came in a very nice case with all the stadard parts...it has preformed flawlessly and exceeded my expetations. After I purchased this Amazon dropped the price 10.00 more dollars which they quickly credited back what a deal. Dewalt makes great air tools I will definetly try them again. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:40:00	No Defect		Novice	No		false
62837784	This combo nailer/compressor was delivered today with no obvious damage to the outside box (Amazon/UPS) and the internal Porter-Cable (P-C) box, however when I opened the latter I found the box containing the brad nailer to be badly beaten up. Once that was opened I found the #34;adjustable belt hook#34; (part #34;I#34; in the instructions) to be broken away from the main gun and clearly damaged. The compressor and gun will no doubt work without this accessory but the fact that this was packaged inside an undamaged P-C outer box makes me question the quality control in play somewhere along the line. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:42:10	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

55170516	Makita has done it with this one.  This jig saw is powerful, easy to use, and runs smooth.  I used it for some projects around the house with excellent results.

42558759	Wonderfull for trim work, moldings, general uses and furniture making.  This is the one that started it all with dual side by side glides, and it is still the best out there.  I have had mine for 9+ years and it is a true as the day I bought it.  I do wish that it beveled both ways, but can work around that.  There has been a lot of inovation in this market since this saw was introduced, but it still holds its own among the pack.  It is extrememly accurate. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:46:24	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

30705381	I am in love with my new dremel!

50844284	I purchased the DeWalt rolling stand and jobsite saw a few months ago, and I am very pleased with both.  I have very little space for storing and using my shop tools, so the compact rolling stand was an attractive option.  The stand is rock solid, and puts the saw at a convenient height.  The whole package (saw and table,) is pretty heavy, but the large wheels make it easy to roll up over the sill out the side door of my garage, and the wide stance of the folding legs keeps the table steady. When packed away, the whole thing takes up about two square feet of floor space in my very tightly packed garage.My only complaint is the lack of an outlet box, either on the saw or the table, to that the saw and dust collector can be plugged in and turned on/off together.Despite that minor inconvenience, I would definitely recommend this table and a matching saw to anyone who is challenged for space. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:48:02	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
22915919	Just another favorable review of one of my favorite power tools...The  weight is right, the handle angle is right, plenty of power, and it works  every time.  I bought this saw to replace a cheap DIY-special Black and  Decker and the difference was a revelation (of course, any  professional-quality tool would have been a revelation).The saw has  lived in indignity under my side bench for years, getting hauled out for a  variety of tasks.  I am a woodworker hobbyist and amateur household  carpenter.  I use this saw for the occasional garden shed, rough-cutting  sheet goods,  and to make sets and furniture for theatrical productions (I  married an actress).  In my light-duty work the saw is a marvel.I cannot  speak to its suitability for a professional framer, but it works great for  me.As a side note, I kind of lust after the left-bladed Porter-Cable,  but I worry about safety.  Is a left-handed blade more dangerous for a  right-handed woodworker?  You can see the blade more easily, which sounds  good to me, but it would put the blade much closer to my left hand (i.e.,  my movable clamp).  Just a question for thought... 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:48:02	Safety Defect		Expert	Yes		false
26470751	Nice drill.  My only complaints are there's no torque adjustment and it did'nt come with a bit as advertised.  As a refurb it was a bit scuffed but no big deal. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:48:02	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
29590458	the drill is not for heavy duty, high speed, for long time usage.  It is prefect for short time usage  minor drilling.  It very convent being cordless  to have as second drill ready to go  for detail work.  For the price I would buy again.  But test the drill within 30 days of receiving it to make sure it does not freeze up.  I returned the 1st drill within the 30 days because the drill stopped working.  Amazon was great about the return no problem from them. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:50:08	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

31002056	This is the standard drill against which I measure all drills.  This isn't the first I've bought - I buy them as gifts for people.  It works well everytime I use it.

33324239	I've been using this product for a while now and the bestthing about it is the vacuum attachment.

48276491	With virtually all products, you can find negative comments. So honestly I was a little reluctant to buy this lathe due to some concerns i read. However, in a similar price point are the Harbor Freight lathes and I read some pretty scary reviews on those lathes. But on this lathe, the price was unbeatable, and if ordered through Amazon the $50 shipping charge from the vendor didn't apply...and I needed a lathe to finish my tall case clock that needed columns in the hood. So I took a chance and bought this lathe. I was surprised at the quality, performance and delivery time. I love this little guy. It's surprisingly heavy for it's size and contrary to other reviews, I had no problem accessing the belt for speed changes. And by the way, it was dead on accurate. I invested in a couple quality turning tools and I turned my walnut columns for the clock without effort. My next project requires turing 29 cherry legs so I'll be buying the extension. If you're looking for a small lathe and you're on a limited budget, in my opinion this is the best value out there. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:52:17	No Defect		Novice	No		false

38130427	I am a novice DIYer.  I have been using this drill for about a month now and it works great.  Small, compact, and I spend the afternoon driving screws with it and did not have to recharge it even after a few hours.  I don't have a lot to compare it to, but it is certainly a lot better than my previous bulky Kawasaki drill.  I suspect the difference is the Lithium battery. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:52:17	No Defect		Novice	No		false
41566327	Have had the 9 piece set for about 4 weeks now and its so far met all my expectations. The only tool I haven't used yet is the cut-out tool but this will probably save the day on some project eventually.As a woman one thing I really like is the shape of the battery; it is easy to get your hand around to release it from the charger one-handed. My last Bosch battery was so wide I couldn't do that and it was very awkard.On the down side the hammer drill/driver is a bit heavy compared to the Bosch, not so heavy that I can't use it but heavy enough to make my thumb ache after a day screwing down siding! Its a great tool though. 3 speeds plus the hammer feature.The circular saw is awesome, lightweight and lightening fast, cuts through stuff like butter. Storage bags are very practical, much better than hard cases. Even the flashlight that I didn't think I'd use is great, powerful light and no more crapped out batteries.Battery life seems good though I haven't owned the set long enough to see any problems.All in all a great set for a great price. Once you've got it you'll wonder what you did without it. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:52:17	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false

45091348	I used to carry a 3/8th inch drill because it was light and fast, and a 1/2 inch hammer drill because it was slow (for large drill bits) and powerful (for drilling concrete, up to 1 inch diameter holes).  This DeWalt is twice as fast as my 3/8th inch drill, twice as powerful as the hammer drill that I wore out, and the variable speed trigger works well, too.  That means I no longer have to carry 2 drills in order to always have the right tool for the job.My shopping expeditions generally found imported junk that felt like it would break in about a week, or big, heavy, 22 inch long, professional drills, with 2 speed transmissions, for way more than I wanted to spend.  I have seen a battery operated hammer drill do the kind of work I do, so knew I didn't need the expensive drills, but I don't like the price of batteries which fail in a year or two.  This drill is right in the middle and exactly what I need; simple, corded, slow, fast, light, and powerful. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:55:32	No Defect		Expert	No		false
34671059	I'm currently using this kit for doing some formwork.  When I drive fasteners, I do it all day long.  I originally bought it for the driver/drill, but I find myself reaching for the impact driver more and more.  The impact driver is light and especially well balanced.  And small. It fits where a driver/drill won't.  Everyone on the jobsite had/has Makita, so I figured it wouldn't hurt if I had something compatible so we could grab a new battery anytime and wouldn't have to worry about compatibility.  Both tools are wonderful.  Using the impact driver, I've yet to exhaust a battery charge...But I know this will change as the nickle-based NiMH cells age. I just hope Makita will develop Lithium based replacement cells that are compatible with it.I thought I might be interested in Panasonic's do-it-all in one tool solution, but I'm pleased that I have two seperate tools on the jobsite.  The more tools on hand, the better.I thought the light that came with it was just a throw-away...boy was I wrong.  It's an amazing light in and of itself.  I know I'll have to us it in a crawl-space one day...and it will do the job easily.Mine came with blow-molded HD polyurethane case with metal latches...and that's great. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:55:32	No Defect		Expert	No		false
32911272	This is an awesome power packed drill. This will hammer any lag bolt you want home. Ergonomically constructed and has little operator fatigue, as a matter of fact it will outlast the person operating it. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:55:32	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
57759637	This is a nice compact design.  Unfortunately the model arrived had a broken clutch and could not turn anything.  Also the battery is contained within the unit so you can't have a backup. 	hanlynn9	10-25-2015 23:55:32	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

32895721	I have one of these in my home shop.  Works great one machine at a time.  Primarily use on a Unisaw  a chop saw.  Have extra flex  move between machines.  Home shop is very small.

Can't beat it for the $$. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:56:09	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
54767838	I am a remodeling contractor.  I use a compressor a lot.  I am very satisfied with this compressor.  It is easily moved, not too heavy and has rubber feet so it won't damage floors.  It obviously doesn't have a huge tank but its recovery time is VERY quick.  It is quieter than an oil free compressor but not as quiet as some of the other oil filled ones I have seen.  It runs a trim nailer no problem.  I even use it for my framing nailer if I am just doing a couple walls.  One more good thing....before I bought this I had a few technical questions.  I called ROLAIRE and got a real person on the phone within seconds who was very knowledgeable about their products and compressors in general.  He talked to me for several minutes and helped me decide this is the one I needed.  I was impressed. 	hyerin94	10-25-2015 23:56:09	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

45583975	I purchased this compressor to use with our Class A Motorhome. I am storing it in the motorhome so that I'm able to adjust tire pressures even when traveling.

39024581	As a home improvement and hobby sort of wood worker looking for top value in essential tools, I did my homework very carefully before choosing this one.Great machine, very comfortable to use with the light weight and smooth power, ergonomically very adjustable, with a brake that stops it cold when you are done (an essential safety feature for someone who nearly sawed his fingers off in his impetuous youth). Great reputation of the company for dependability and quality, so I expect it to last to be handed down to my son or daughter. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:08:10	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
53910736	I purchased this wet cutting circular saw for  cutting flagstone in the field.  I already have a MK101 for tile.  The stones are large and heavy and I needed a machine that could cut the stone on the ground. I am able to score the stone and then finish the cut with a brick chisel.  The cuts are often over 2' long in 2 thick stone.  I replaced the tile cutting blade with a diamond, segmented rim blade for a quicker cut.  The blade that came with the saw was ok but was slow for the my purpose. The saw is fairly quiet and has adequate power.  I installed a hose clamp at the saw end of the water feed to keep the tube attached to the saw. I would prefer a saw with a larger blade capacity, more power and a greater water flow.  The saw is a big improvement over using a dry cut blade. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:10:24	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

25909097	I previously owned the 12v Hitachi impact driver from about four years ago and it was a great little tool. (still is) When the batteries were in better condition I could assemble cabinets all day and sink the occasional handful of #8 3 screws when needed for installs.I picked up this micro 12v? (it feels like 10)combo and thought it could at least handle  1-1/4 pocket screws in white oak face frames. It does, but the speed is greatly reduced and I could feel the little motor screaming under load. 1-1/2 screws in 3/4 ply was surprisingly slower as well. My old 12v Hitachi would handle these simple tasks with ease.This drill driver combo is an excellent little kit for light duty tasks such as cabinet hinge installation and drawer glides if that's all you needed it for everyday.My current go-to set is the 18v Bosch drill-driver and impact gun, these new guns are so light they feel like the old 9v of long ago. I thought I'd give these little Hitachis a shot since I couldn't pass up the price ($137.00)but they got returned to the store.I won't downgrade their usefullness for lighter applications, they simply didn't suit mine. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:12:11	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

56255411	I purchased this product to resurface my kitchen cabinetry.  Works very well and strips old finishes even in hard to get at corners and offsets.  Sands evenly.  Changing out extensions, changing speeds, etc. is simple and convenient.  Nice hard, compact case for storage.  Finding anything other than what comes with the kit though, is a chore.

56457600	I have to admit,I've always been one of those pro carpenters that thought DeWalt saws looked and worked cheaply. Like many of you, I have used every chop saw and dual compound miter saw imaginable. Years later I became a woodshop teacher. When I started, the old teacher before me had an nice new Makita and good old Hitachi stuffed in the back tool storage room and this saw set up prominently out on the shop floor. I decided to leave it there and see what would happen over the course of the school year.I watched this saw get day in and day out abuse from students who cut too fast, started the saw while touching the work, let the saw run too long, let the saw snap back to its upright position, chopped wood not against the fence, never cleaned the blade or used wicked dull blades all day. I had students using pine and the saw covered in sap that hardened to amber. (hey I can hear you judging me fellas, I had thirty-two inner city kids in these classes [no injuries-knock on wood]. One week I had students blazing away for hours chopping hickory and pecan, leaving the saw hot to the touch.Long story short: you couldn't find a better field testing environment than a high school shop class. Despite this merciless abuse, this saw cut perfectly accurate. It is loud, and the brake doesn't like the kind of resharpened heavy blades I use, but nonetheless, after school, I made fine furniture with this same saw. I made tight perfect miters with it It could chop cleanly through 12/4 rock maple full of nails on a dull blade (I know all of you are wincing, that's why I used a beater blade)I used it to chop and cut shoulders on giant 5 in dovetails in 8/4 Bubinga. or trimming off a 64th of the same without it drifting away...always leaving my work dead on 90 degrees. We cut dirty two by fours, weird laminates, acrylic, you name it, this saw performed.This proves to me that this saw has earned it's chops for the jobsite. Period. I wish I could say the same about DeWalt biscuit joiners. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:14:09	No Defect		Expert	No		false

Easy to assemble - all the parts were there and the instructions clear.  I mainly use for woodworking, so can't comment on utility for more precise machining in metal.Laser doesn't work on mine - and if it were a more expensive tool I suppose I might have returned it or asked for a replacement laser, but I wasn't really planning on using it, so am still satisfied. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:19:30	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

NOPE, i was completely wrong. the other review pretty much described it exactly. i pulled it out of the box and it looked like it had been used, returned and spraypainted. the wheels were falling off and when i started it up it sounded like it was going to explode. after i let it fill up for a while it was leaking like crazy from around the adjusting knob. after i got the working i hooked up an impact gun to it and it wouldnt work the gun. thats when i put it back in the box and did the return. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:19:48	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
57565456	I purchased this set to replace a declining DeWalt 14v drill that I really liked.  This new Porter-Cable drill is my new favorite.  Excellent power and lighter than my DeWalt.  The battery charges quickly and the charger is smart - showing charging status, battery/line faults, etc.  The driver put a 1/2#34; lag bolt into concrete like I was screwing it into wood (nice pilot hole was thanks to the P-C drill).The case is soft vs. the DeWalt hard case, but that's OK with me. It sufficiently protects the drill and driver and is lighter than a hard case.  The LED work lights on each unit are a nice touch.  Not sure (yet) what could be improved on this set, thus the 5 stars.So far, I'm very happy with this kit. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:19:48	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
51049241	This product didn't work correctly from the beginning.  The LED work light didn't come on but the motor turned.  So, instead of returning it I decided to give it a try.  That try lasted less than 10 min and the motor locked up.  I called Rich Power Inc, as the service and support instruction say to do, and the customer service rep would only send me another one to try, when I asked for a refund they told me that it was not their refund to issue, I had to go back to the place I bought it. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:21:11	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false

36631570	I'm using the press to drill home-etched PCB's. It works well.  Using the drill before etching, however, there is a bit of slippage.  Maybe 1/20th of an inch.

61523630	First time Milwaukee convert. A little hesitant to buy this, as its quite hard to find it here in my country. Although there was a hiccup with the charger, glad that Amazon has fantastic customer service.I am very surprised with this bugger. Feels very solid, much better than my 9.6V Black  Decker. Handle my needs very well. Very very happy with this product. My new main drill.Just a minor complaint, the direction button for reverse and forward is a tad to easily moved. Have to watch out when you are removing or inserting screw, it get switched easily. Would have helped if the switch requires more pressure to change.Delivered super fast for international shipping. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:21:11	No Defect		Novice	No		false

85769849	I received the Max Gyro as a gift for my birthday and liked it so much I bought one for all my friends.  Intuitive use makes it easy to use one hand and it is much lighter than any cordless drill used as a screwdriver.  I am satisfied with the torque and the LED light makes it easy to find screws in dark crevices.  I have used in building three sets of shelves and permanent wooden baby gates for the bar in our house and have been very happy to have it.The only drawback to it is that it doesn't have storage built into the unit for both the phillips and flat head bits.  The recepticle on the unit is shallow and won't accept a two sided bit (one with flathead on one side and phillips on the other) so you will need to have access to both bits. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:22:20	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
41684322	This saw has plenty of power, the guides are pretty decent for the price, runs smoothly, is not too heavy to move around, and is in general a fine piece of equipment.  The included fence is, for my purposes, a complete and utter piece of junk.  I tried and tried to get used to it, enjoy it, whatever.  However, it IS possible to upgrade the fence, though not with another Grizzly product (I asked their helpful customer service team... one insisted the fence was the greatest thing since sliced bread, the other admitted that the position of the release handle was less than ideal).  The fence to upgrade to (don't even think about it, if you own one, just do it.  and if thinking of buying this saw, order the fence at the same time) is the JET 708747 (asin B0002ZHF3S).Basically, the grizzly fence is lightweight, doesn't move terribly smoothly, does not lock down tightly enough for me to be confident (though admittedly I have not actually slid the fence while locked), and worst of all (this is horrifying) to release the fence you must raise the handle, which is 2 inches to the RIGHT of the fence!!!! That means if you have wood more than 1.5 inches wide/thick along the fence, you must REMOVE the wood from the table before repositioning the fence (!!!!!).  This is the most shockingly stupid design I could imagine.The Jet fence is an astoundingly huge improvement.  I had to wait a month to get mine from Amazon.  It comes with an excellent resaw attachment.  If you plan to resaw with this saw (and it is truly excellent as a resaw saw after upgrading the fence) do the fence upgrade.  This saw would get 5 stars from me for value IF it came with a decent fence.The nice thing about the Jet fence upgrade is that it bolts right on (keep your original screws from the Grizzly fence) and requires only one hole/notch drilled in the back of the fence to mount the rear skid guide, apparently the Grizzly table is about 3/4 inch deeper than the 16 Jet bandsaw table.Using the 1 wide 3/4 varitooth carbide tipped blade offered by grizzly for this saw, resawing up to full capacity of the saw is a breeze.  The blade is pricey but worth it.  I believe the brand for the blade is Lenox.******Update, after using this saw for a couple years, my opinions stand:  great saw, awful (stock) fence.  The reason I'm updating the review is I noticed that Grizzly has introduced an improved model, the G0513X2, which has cast iron wheels, a bigger table, a cast iron trunnion, and a different fence.  I haven't used it, but I'm guessing the fence is a big improvement (anything would be better than the stock fence, and I still enjoy using the Jet fence described above).  I wish I could upgrade with parts, but apparently not possible.  If I were buying a saw now, I'd pay the extra $200 for the G0513X2, also they have a 19 3HP model for $550 more that looks really nice and fits a wider blade for resawing.  But this saw is still a good one, which I use for most of my milling while the table saw gathers dust. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:22:20	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
25621919	I've used a larger 7 1/2 inch Dewalt circular saw for years. But now it's getting cobwebs because of this Rockwell RK3441K compact saw.  This compacts saw is so darn handy, lays easily in my tool bag, is more convenient than my larger traditional circular saw to tot around that it's becoming my go-to saw for small to intermediate cuts in wood and metal.It has a nice /precise /quality rip fence and angle cut feature and the knobs are quick and secure to set any angle cut.  I particularly love the blade being on the left side of the drive. This dramatically increased my vision over the cut so it's safer, more accurate, user friendly and better results.My hands are average size (size 8-9 glove size Large) and I find the grip size /surface  design easy to hold on to and user friendly.  For small hands this might be a challenge.  The trigger pull is less complicated that other saws this size with makes this model Rockwell easier to operate and control while cutting than all other saws this size...in my opinion.The blade turns as a slower RPM than my full size Dewalt, but if you slow down your feed this saw handles anything I throw it's way giving a clean crisp cut and does not bog down. For big tough jobs simply use a bigger saw.  The blade I found Best for all around cuts in wood /metal /longevity was a Freud D0436X Diablo 4-3/8-Inch 36 Tooth ATB Cordless Trim Saw Blade that I've used with no issues at all.I am not easy to impress, but this compact medium duty Rockwell has earned its way into my inner circle of tools.  I am Very pleased with the quality features, portability and durability of this handy saw. Recommend this without reservations and consider the hundred dollar cost a fair value.----UPDATE----Have used this Rockwell saw for several months now and and it's still rock solid.  No issues at all. The adjustable guide fence is real handy,...quick and secure adjustment lever,...easy to make quick /secure fence adjustments.I've also used this saw in unconventional situations where I had to remove material from wood in such a way I was able to turn the saw over, expose the blade and carefully angle the wood into the blade to free-hand  create a router type effect.  It was the only way to finish a particular cut and this saw has the flexibility to help.  Never know what you'll run into during a project and glad this saw has extra flexibility to adapt.  Continues to earn my unqualified recommendation! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:22:20	No Defect		Expert	No		false
38561648	I have owned this saw since 1997 and it has been a daily use tool on my job sites.  It has cut through just about everything imaginable and has never been pampered. The power of this saw is top of the line as is the base plate. The saw was built to last and it has for me for almost 15 years. My only complaint with this saw is that it worked so well for so long that when the switch finally went on it in November 2011 I found that I'm having trouble finding a replacement. I really hate to throw the saw away because it is the best saw I've ever used and I have grown quite fond of it's reliability. If anyone knows a place to get a new switch for the saw please leave a comment and let me know where, I would greatly appreciate it. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:22:20	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

29906386	I'm a retired mechanical engineer and after many years of frustration I finally took mine apart to see why it was so inaccurate.  It is really too bad because the machine has a very strong motor / arbor system using an induction motor which are generally better and more reliable than the brush type motor used in many routers.  HOWEVER,  the very sturdy shaft that holds the router bit is mounted so that it has about 1/8#34; vertical play.  It can not make accurate cuts.  I am not even going to bother putting it back together.  I hope the garbage man will take it. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:23:58	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

36515151	As I stare at my box full of old cordless drills and their depleted NiCad batteries, I can only wish that this drill was available much earlier. After retiring my DeWalts and Makita's and realizing that there is no shame in using an extension cord, I vowed never to throw money away again at a cordless and their overpriced NiCad batteries.Forced into a job site with no power, I purchased this drill from Amazon at a good price and put it through its paces with a variety of drill loads. Some specifics:1) The first impression has to be its small size, weight, quality of feel, balance. Obvious quality of materials and manufacturing.2)The chuck has to be the best that I have ever used. Easiest to change bits, extremely tight grip on both small (1/16) and large bits. Outstanding engineering concept and achievement.3) Speed control has two ranges and mesh perfectly from slow driver speed to fast drilling. Excellent trigger feel and response.4) And now the power. Don't even think of stalling this brute. The 3.5AH NiMH batteries have incredible reserve and recharge capablity. The charger is well designed and will quickly charge a depleted battery. These batteries seem to last all day.If you are thinking of a (the) top quality cordless drill that will last for many years and handle any job, this is the obvious choice. Well worth the cost, which is price competitive with the other 15-18v drill selections.You deserve this !! 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:26:29	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

47854837	I bought this Gold Box offering as a gift for my husband--a retired contractor--who never has enough power tools.  He had nothing but excellent things to say about the quality and power of this tool.  It came with two batteries---worth the price alone---with charger and case.

51418823	I bought this due to the good reviews it received and the recommendation of a friend.  I've used it on several projects and found it to be the perfect tool to have around the house.  With the recent move, I found myself hanging drapes, installing blinds, and putting up shelves.  This tool was up to each of the tasks.  I've used it many times over the last month, yet I still haven't charged it for the first time.  The carrying case is also handy; I can fit the set of screwdriver heads I purchased with the tool into it. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:29:09	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

There is everything I will ever need (even more), and the quality is stellar. I had absolutely no problem with any of the tools. Having the same batteries across all made it very easy to get things done without having to chase a different charger every time, while the power of the 18v and the battery duration has proven more than enough for all the jobs I had to do so far. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:29:09	No Defect		Novice	No		false
55370740	I got this grinder at Lowe's because they were cheaper. I only got it because of the lower speed to sharpen lathe tools . It ran fine for about 10 min. on the slower speed then suddenly it started running at top speed. The speed control had no effect on it. I felt of the motor and it was so hot you couldn't leave your hand on it. I turned it off and waited till it cooled down and turned it back on. It only had the top speed . So I guess I just got a Lemon. I returned it to Lowes for a refund. Good luck if you buy this model. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:29:09	Safety Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

As per other DeWalt products I've owned, it's very well made and can handle some abuse. Years later I bought one of my own after I left the company.This is a powerful tool and can get away from someone not used to using it. Also it is a little hefty and will wear on your arms after extended use. I happen to like the weight as it seems to give me a little more control than one that is lightweight and just feels better in my hands. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:31:48	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

72146548	I have a corded Milwaukee Sawzall, having gone through a Harobr Freight knock-off in short order. The positive experience witht he new saw led me to consider a Milwaukee cordless. I'm glad I did. I have heard for some time that they are the best on the market, and when I saw this system at about 300 bucks and shipping, I jumped on it. The 4 Ampere-hour batteries last so long that I don't take the charger with me for one-day jobs. The little screw-gun is now my main tool. I bought hex-shank drills, and use it for everything. The big drill comes out only for harder jobs, or ones requiring more versatility. I have Makita and black and Devker tools as well, and have great respect for Dewalt, but in my opinion, this Milwaukee system tops them all. I even use the impact driver (screw gun) for light automotive work, despite having a large compressor and pleny of air tools. The Milwaukee is light, and usually closer to hand. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:31:48	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

58638110	I couldn't be happier with Makita's 9903 sander.  The belt tracking on this sander is unparalleled by any other I've used.  In addition, the variable speed and balance of the sander make even delicate tasks seem easy.  The dust collection system is also superior to any other belt sander I've run. I would recommend the 9903 sander to anyone looking for a professional-grade tool that will survive years of use. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:37:34	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

28570788	By far, after performing hours of cost comparison research, the best value drill on the market. At the price of $56.99, this drill cannot be beat on a cost basis.

61580950	Having bought into the new Lithium Ion Phosphate battery technology with an XRP impact driver, I was eager to add a drill unit. The impact driver has been excellent and the Dewalt battery technology appears to have the edge in the market at the moment. We have a lot of older Dewalt XRP 18V NiCad tools on the jobsite and they are all workhorses. They are all expected to run hard and strong and for a long time on a charge, so only the XRP units are used.It seemed a no brainer to first add the new DCD970 hammerdrill/driver, with improved clutch control, speed selection, better chuck, and more compact body with the lithium XRP batteries. I tightened that great chuck down on a 1/2 drill bit and was completely amazed at how much play there was in the spindle. I could rock that spindle around in any direction. Bad bearing, loose bearing retainer? What could the problem possibly be here? A hammerdrill has to have in and out play to allow for the hammer feature, but there shouldn't be any radial play - 0! - and this felt like a tool that had fallen off a ladder and cracked it's bearing housing. I looked everywhere and couldn't find any visible problem and the tool really looked new, original packing in place and no charge on the batteries - just the way it should be. Radial play means oscillation in use and oscillation develops wear. Any drill of substance has a tight front end - no play in the spindle. Our 6 six year old Dewalts are absolutely tight. All of my heavy duty corded drills are absolutely tight after years of use.This is entirely unacceptable to me as a long time professional tool user. I sent the unit back, hoping that I had a rare lemon and ordered the DCD960 drill/driver unit without the hammer - same drill but no hammer drill feature. It has exactly the same issue. I went to a major building supply house and tried the DCD970 that came packaged with an impact driver - same issue. I called Dewalt and the customer service rep insisted that they have no problem with these units and have received no complaints.I went on ebay and ordered a used DW988 drill/driver/hammerdrill 18V NiCad unit. That's at least a six year old tool. The front end is tight as it should be. I'll be asking Amazon to take back the DCD960 and I'll keep the old 988. Dewalt thankfully has made their new battery series back-compatible with the old tools. It looks pretty clunky having that big tool body on the little L-ions but it works and I know that the 988 is in it for the long haul despite it's rather minor limitations. When I need a big hole in a timber with no power around, it will be the go to tool.There have been several iterations of this tool since the 988, including the DW925, 950, probably some others, so some of them may be OK. I will be asking Dewalt again for some clarification about my experience. The new tool has a molded in collar that forms a skirt around the base of the chuck. The older tools, at least the 988, has the spindle exposed at the base of the chuck. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:41:30	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

I looked at the new DeWalt 3 x 21 sander  don't care for the weight or balance of it.This Rigid belt sander soft-start takes a little getting used to, but the tool works great.

58704022	I only recently acquired this nailer so I can't offer much advice on its use and durability. In essence, what Senco has done is re-purpose the pneumatic driver from their Palm nailer by adding an extended nose piece, magazine, and handle. If you expect it to drive a nail in one hit, like a standard nailgun, you'll be surprised. The way you use this thing is to insert the point of the nail (which protrudes about 1/4 from the nosepiece)into the hole in a metal joist hanger and push down. This activates the Palm-Nailer powerhead which proceeds to administer consecutive hammer blows to the nailhead until it is fully driven. The powerhead then stops automatically. This process is pretty quick and certainly an improvement over using your fingers and a hammer.One thing that was a challenge for me is figuring out what nails to use. The user manual says to use only genuine Senco fasteners.... But, alas, there are no Senco part numbers I could find for this type of nailgun. I had to work with a hardware supplier who had to contact his Senco rep twice before being told that this gun can use any ...31-35 degree joist hanger nails. Further research revealed that the correct specs are: 35 degree paper strip collated metal connector nails of .131, .148, .162 in diameter and either 1.5 or 2.5 in length. Nails can be either bright nickel finish or hot dipped galvanized. I have successfully fired Bostich galvanized StrapShot Metal connector nails 1.5 x .148 and 2.5 x .162 in my gun.Although I don't have the similar Senco HN150 Joist Nail Hanger, my research leads me to believe that it will not handle the .162 diameter nails. That seems to be the major difference between it and the HN250 that is the subject of this review.I hope this helps someone. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:44:25	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
45360266	If, like me, you are wary of the cordless drills that fail to hold a charge after 7-10 years, you can't go wrong with this corded drill.

Product came with broken switch on work light, fortunately it's stuck 'ON' so I know when it's plugged in.Getting the smaller woodworking blades to cut straight is difficult.  Have to closely monitor the spacing of the upper AND lower guides.  Larger metal type blades were much easier to manage.Not a heavy duty machine for all day cutting.  Exhaust system does not clean out the fine saw dust, even with a powerful shop-vac attached.It's fine for occasional, light work.

54870469	I bought this one during a super sale on Amazon, and I wasn't disappointed. It comes with the standard attachments, with the familiar circle of punched holes in the mounting ring. The tool is a lot quieter than the Harbor Freight one, and it also has a small fan that dissipates the heat very well (you can see the small orange circular exhaust port at the back of the tool). Vibration isn't bad, about the same as a regular random orbit sander. The tool feels pretty solid, with the aluminum head and rubber body. Other than that, it's similar to all the Craftsman/ Dremel/ Rockwell multi tools, except it's a lot cheaper. Definitely a great buy. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:46:53	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

27009363	The ordering process was fine and the lathe arrived quickly.  I did have to go to UPS to pick it up due to the fact my farm was not accessible by tractor -trailer.  UPS would not deliver with a panel truck.Assembly was straight forward and easy to do.  A second persons certainly helps with the assembly, weight of the parts being the major issue here.Turned a small 8.5 no problems moved up to a 10 bowl bout 3 inches deep...started to notice some vibration. at one point the head-stock vibrated into the tool rest and chipped the bowl edge. I tighten everything back up and finished the bowl.Next I started a 11 x 5 walnut bowl...this size of bowl is what I bought this lathe for.  Right off I had some heavy vibration (note I had rounded the blank on my band saw before placing on the lathe).  I assumed that it must be off center a bit so I fought through rounding/balancing the blank. The vibration did not get any better in fact seem to get worse over time.  I could not get a clean cut on the blank due to the vibration.  The head-stock came loose repeatedly.  I finally stopped working the bowl and wrapped in a trash bag until I could figure out the problem.After some research I decided to bolt the lathe to the floor.  In addition, I added a shelf under the lathe and placed 300lbs of sand bags on the shelf.  I was certain  this would solve my issue...not to be. I experienced the same vibrations and head-stock coming loose. I stopped turning the blank and wrapped it up again.Time to call Grizzly tech support.  They did not know what to make of this problem and asked me to take a video of what was going on and send it to them.  Here is the link to the video on youtube. http://youtu.be/VlofFQ9Psfc if you want to see what I'm taking about.It's been three days now with nothing but an email saying they will get back to me.  Called today to get an update and was told I'll get a call back today.  Sure hope so.My hope is Grizzly can make this right.  The lathe is a great price for a 2HP motor which I assumed would work for larger bowls.  I should have known better than to go with one of the cheapest lathes on the market.  Seemed to good to be true...and is was.  I'll post a follow-up once Grizzly gets back with me and hopefully resolves the problem.  But for now my recommendation is to avoid this lathe.Update 6/26/13After 3 days of calling I talked to the right person at tech support.  After reviewing they said they had never seen anything like this.  And will be sending me a new head-stock. I will update again once received and tested.Update 7/10/2013Got the new head-stock in and installed. Tried turning the same bowl blank...while the vibration was reduced a great deal it still is too much to turn the bowl.  Changing speeds was much easier than on the original head-stock.  Tried for about 30 mins to get a good cut but it is not to be.  I was really hoping this would fix the problem.  The price was great for a lathe this size...but I should have know it was too good to be true.  Any way I have contacted Grizzly and requested to return for a refund. Still waiting on a response. Now I need to decide on another lathe.  Any ideas...I want to be able to turn bowl 12-15 inches. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:46:53	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

40241739	Worked great in my 8#34; round chimney, it was surprisingly easy and quick to use. Thought a project would be in order but I was done and all cleaned up in 30 minutes and ready to burn some wood.

40944419	Like many people, i use tools from time to time around the house, so there is no point in buying a $300 tool when one like this is available. so far i have used it on 3 projects, and it's still going strong. It does warm up, so i use it for 5 mins then let it rest for 10... then use again.This is no Bosch, but it great for the price. If you are building a house, buy an expensive one.. If you are working on a few small projects, this is great 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:47:06	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

54363509	This is a sweet machine! It's my first router. After reading many, many reviews, I decided on the Bosch. I am now a firm believer in taking the time to read the reviews for anything I buy. It's pretty easy to figure out which reviewers are reliable and know what they're talking about. This really helps with making a purchase. I am totally satisfied with the Bosch and it has lived up to everything the other reviewers have said about it. Buy this one. You won't be sorry. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:47:06	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
44204225	It was so wonderful to use putting a new Ping Pong table together because it had a bunch of screws. also I had some tight right angle I had to reach and it work prefect, I feel I have got my money back already using the drill. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:47:06	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

49214128	I am new to wood turning, but I am really happy that I chose this machine to start on. It is HEAVY (which is good) and easy to use. To do what I wanted to do I have had to buy some accessories, but that is normal for a new hobby. As long as you are doing small work like pen turning, or cork rod grips and reel inserts it is the perfect size and easy to place in the shop.  And, of course, the free shipping is a MAJOR bonus with such a heavy item. Highly recommended. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:48:40	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
57433353	The V belt used to shift speed is too short. If the thumb screw is released, and the motor is pulled all the way forward, the belt is still too tight on the pullies.

49968169	I've always wanted a Dewalt drill and now that I have one I'm glad I bought it. I've owned MANY cordless drills from Craftsman to Black and Decker and most in between. The secret is in the battery. This drill comes with two. I've fallen for the cheapo Harbor Freight $20 drills but they last about a year. The drill doesn't die but the battery does. It simply doesn't hold a charge. I can shelf my Dewalt for 6 months and it holds a charge like new. Not that you'd want to but the battery quality makes ANY cordless tool. Well balanced and just feels right. To me well worth the $$. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:49:42	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

52173059	This is a great product from Hitatchi.Pros:  strong driver for long screws into wood, compact size and weight, long battery life, cool alien pattern on handle, good quality case, ease of useCons: there is no way to regulate the clutch on the driver function so it starts to ratchet when a certain amount of torque is detected, the rachet function is kinda loud when you are driving screws 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:52:25	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
28556116	What a great tool. Cut some baseboard off to fit in cabinets, 2 minutes. Cut a door jamb to fit new flooring, 5 minutes. Sand a hard to get area around a chair spindle, 5 minutes. Battery run time is good and you've got 2 with a quick charger. This isn't a tool for the construction site, [well maybe for cutting box holes in drywall], but for the serious DIYer it's indispensable. Right up their with a sawz all. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:52:25	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
56928758	I take almost every crosscut to the miter saw, so for me a circular saw is only for cutting sheet goods so they will fit on the tablesaw, and the occasional trimming of large wainscoting panels.  The Bosch is a nice saw with good cut-line visibility for right handed users.  Power is more than adequate.  It follows a clamp and guide straightedge very well.My only negatives are minor...1.  The blade it comes with is carbide, but for framing.  I switched to a 40 tooth Freud as I do with all my saws.  The stock blade has a tendency to kick back, while the Freud will not. P.S. the blade goes on backwards for left-blade saws.  IE: the Bosch blade is installed with logo facing outward, but Freud and other blades install with the logo facing inward.2.  The saw is a little heavier than a 6-1/2 circular saw, but is has more power too.  I chose this saw over the smaller versions for its ability to perform standard framing cuts.  I think it weighs about 10 lbs.3.  There is no safety switch.  You know that little button you depress before you can start the saw?  The Bosch doesn't have one.  I never cock the blade gaurd back with a pencil, so it's not an issue for me.  Just be careful.The construction is robust, and fit and finish is good.  It comes with some nice features like an onboard blade wrench, and a tool-free spindle lock.  Very Nice. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:52:25	Safety Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

22887220	Came looking like new with all parts in excellent condition. It is light enough for use in the field but powerful enough for real work. Compared to other routers I have owned this one is a keeper.  Especially like the soft start, variable speed, and control locations. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:52:25	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

27363818	I've owned this for a few weeks now and am very happy with it. Highest marks for battery life of course, I work with aluminum and this will put more holes and screws in 1/4 inch stock than any other. Typically lasts a day of fairly steady use on one charge. Also thrilled with the cold weather performance. Doesn't seem to be phased by temps in the single digits unlike NiCad or Lithium and still takes a charge well (my reason for returning my last  new compact tough was horrible low temp performance). Although there are other brands that claim more torque I can't see how, I buried 4 inch lags in a maple log on day one to test it, which I couldn't do with a corded 3/8 chuck. Also seems tough, taken multiple 3 ft falls onto concrete and a 6 fter into snow, though only time will really tell. Only downside is the weight, especially the battery but I feel it's well worth it. Lack of bit holders (except between batt and drill base?!) is inconvenient but glue ons are available. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:54:49	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
58683376	I have had one of these drills for a number of years and have no problems with it at all. I work as a commercial electrician and use it on a daily basis it's great for doing trim and other finish activities when you don't want to carry around your big 18 volt.

43322957	I've had several small impact drivers.  Though the Craftsman isn't the strongest or the most compact, it certainly does  anything you ask of it.  A battery charge lasts a long time and the power is enough to get most any drilling or driving accomplished. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:56:29	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
55193994	So far so good. i needed it for my nail gun and for some light jobs and it's just perfect for this.the built quality is great . just replace the springy tube with a decent one plus installa quick detachable connector and you gonna be happy with this compressor. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:56:29	No Defect		Novice	No		false
39321160	just one week after I received my drill, I saw it for 1/2 of what I paid at Home Depot.It's a fine product, but a disappointing price (I am suprised that Amazon does not offer any price protection)- as always, the service was good, the delivery was on time etc., but it was not the value I had hoped for. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:56:29	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false

56231581	Great for anyone who is tired of loosing, searching and fumbling with bits. It keeps them all inside ready to be used at a moments notice. Why 4 stars? The only reason is variable speed. There are other features this doesn't have like a clutch to avoiding over tightening. And it would be nice if it came with a gun holster, especially for the price. All in all though it's a good purchase. You can buy a holster (which I did) and if it had variable speed it wouldn't need a clutch as much. To sum up, you won't be disappointed cause it's cool, fun to use and the quality is great. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:56:29	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

41206859	I have to say that I am surprised by this small product especially the torque output is exceptional.One of the best features is that with a full charge u will get 45 continuous minutes of screwing and unscrewing action.Charging does take 3 hours but the good thing is since its a slow charge the battery will have a extended life.the 16 torque settings are more than enough for the applications that you will be using this for and will make sure that no screws will be stripped 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:56:52	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

22204165	A lot cheaper than the infomercial brand... I use it a lot for hard to reach places I can't get a regular saw or sander in...Easy to use with excellent results.

29868388	Seems to be a good product and does its job, but the cheap, almost useless nozzles/fittings are terrible. I am going to have to go out an buy a nozzle that has a lever to release air because the one that came with it just lets the air go out if the valve is open. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:59:29	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
55283780	I don't have problem with the equipment itself, it is perfect and I like it.Shipping was horrible, once I open the package there is a black insert inside the t-box which was broken from several places. Then there is a accessories box inside the t-box that was broken too.I didn't care much about that as long the equipment is in good conation and all the accessories are in the box. Maybe because of the weight this has happened and if Amazon won't fix this issue with their shipping some customer may return the item. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:59:29	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
42738780	After making height and depth adjustments, I trimmed some baseboard using this saw.I know it isn't industry standard, but my walls are old and the baseboard has several coats of paint.  Pulling it off and perhaps having to replace it or damaged wallboard isn't an added task I wanted.I took off perhaps 1/4 inch in places.  The saw worked great!As with all power tools, please be careful and be aware of where your limbs, appendages and cords are at all times.My project is a DIY. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 00:59:29	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

7574268	Love this drill - It is my go to drill when I need to get something done fast. It is a little on the heavy side compared to the newer drills out on the market, but the added weight is nice when you are using the Hammer Drill. Added with the quick charging batteries and the work light this is a great little combo kit. As with all my Dewalt batteries, I write on the date that I bought my drill so I will know when I am getting close to the end of my warranty. By doing this I have gotten my worth out of the drill by keeping my batteries at peak performance. I have the new Rigid drill as well so I will be seeing how the two stacks up overtime. My first thought is that Rigid's 18V Drill is lighter, but I the extra weight in the Dewalt makes it better for drill through cement. So if you are into wood working only go with Rigid - but if you find yourself doing multipurpose uses with a drill go Dewalt. Just my two cents worth. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 00:59:40	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

46482952	The bare tool is the only way to go if you already have other DEWALT tools and batteries. The one problem is the trigger switch is the only weak link in this tool. It does not like to have the batteries inserted to hard. The contact tips will bend or break and the switch costs about $50.00 USD. Be careful if using it under a house or where foreign objects can enter the battery cavity during battery change out.

22809770	after reading other reviews, I decided to buy this tool to lay oak flooring (400 sq ft) instead of renting a tool (I have done this in the past).  I oiled the tool well before starting and the nails were a fraction of an inch off from the nail bed with the wood I got from holme thepot.  So I removed the white spacer on the bottom and added a couple of pieces of paper to shim it.  Then it worked great!  I wish I had bought it for my last job.The tool comes with a hammer (although not in the pictures), spare o-rings, and some tools to disassemble the tool if needed. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:00:37	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
61029441	Have had no problems with the manufacturing or the usable versatility or the product. The Shaper arrived by a freight truck - no problems with that. However, the driver alerted us to the fact that the package was very damaged and was concerned about the contents inside. The box was hardly in its original shape at all.

28387273	The tool worked well, but I question its durability.  The amount of torque applied to the pins caused the pins to bend. They did not break, and we were able to get the job completed. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:02:09	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

59682902	This tool is absolutely fabulous for doing the few things you will need it for, but and this is a BIG but (pun alert!) the replacement blades are VERY expensive--no joke, check the prices. The profile sanding attachment doesn't work worth a darn. Because of the rotary-vibratory motion of tool, the ends of the little piece of sandpaper do all the work and the center does nothing. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:02:09	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

57847349	I've only had this a few days, and I'm already in love with it. I fried my Hoover trying to pick up orchid bark that a thoughtful cat knocked over a plant and left for me, believing that I didn't have enough to do. After fretting over how to pick up the mess, I remembered these great products called dry/wet vacs. I did some research online, and this little one seemed perfect. Well, it is. It's picked up the original mess, and I quite frankly find it much easier to use in corners and other hidden places than messing with my upright vacuum. My only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner. No excuse in my case. We have a similar product on our boat for catching the dust from sanding teak, so I did know that these sorts of things exist. This is a better model than our little boat-exclusive Shop Vac. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 01:02:52	No Defect		Novice	No		false

60341834	We had jams and the plastic that holds nails together goes all over and the nail capacity is small , it will shoot 3-1/2 s into lvls where others fail . Overall like all tools they preform and shine in different ways 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 01:02:52	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

50929768	The perfect size for a small shop setting. Very powerful for it's size and with a great selection of tools to reach any place. Easy to store and clean. Would recommend to anyone that needs a light, compact, and powerful shop vacuum for small settings! 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:03:39	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
42537147	I never used a framing nailer before, I needed one for some home projects I was going to start. Well after buying all the supplies (extra batt., fuel cells, non-mar tip, and nails) I found this to be a little expensive somewhere around [$], but after using it many times with quick set-up I found this tool very useful. There is no lugging compressors around, by the way, to purchase a framing nailer and a decent compressor you are pretty close in price to this product. The nailer really works well it will drive nails with ease, would definitely recommend for the Do-it-yourselfer! 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:03:39	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
55375934	Too weak to turn many screws. Good for only minor jobs. Runs totally out of power too quickly before you have to charge it again. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:03:39	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
53403952	Used this for my plasma cutting setup for a project that I just completed. Has sufficient airflow for use in this task, and is much more quiet than my red pancake HDepot standard model that I've had forever.As others have noted, packaging and shipping are hit and miss. The plastic cover to the control box was cracked upon opening due to the heavy thing shifting around in the box during shipping, but nothing else was bent or broken.Works well, can run 2 hoses, controls are tight and precise. The starter switch/wire is a little weird and not really crisp when moving to the on/off position, but it seems to be fine.The sheet metal that hold the gauges is a little thin. May not hold up to direct abuse, but seems again, to be ok.The purge valve on the bottom works easily and well. Not much water has been coming out, but it is winter and humidity has been low. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:03:39	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
35922083	Really love what they have done with the design. My son loves it, the teachers love it and it's easy to identify in a crowd.  Day two the seam holding the top to the back stared to fray.  Can't take it away from my son to return, may have to buy a second one to return it so he' doesn't know its a new one. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:04:43	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

57820321	As a female who only uses tools to hang the occasional curtain rode or put a desk together it works great. Having never used a drill before it seemed pretty self explanatory and simple to figure out. On the two occasions I have used it over the past few months there have not been any problems. Its nice to be able to to put things together and not have to feel like I need to call my brother to come over and help anytime something needs to be done. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:04:43	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
23459828	- the reason i wanted a power stapler is the awkward positions that artists get in, stretching canvasses.- but at least a manual gun fires when you squeeze it.- this thing if iffy. i can't figure its 'rule' for when it will fire. i suppose it is some safety factor but they need to work on it more in real conditions.doneastwest. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:04:43	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

31285871	Milwaukee cordless circular saw, only takes 6,5 in blade, probably do to power limitations, but it works real well for most jobs.  I am a satisfied buyer. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:07:16	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
58228956	This is a great item. Just right for all my needs around the house and the best part is I dont have to go to a gas station to put air on my cars tires. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:07:16	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

49264317	I've used DeWalt, Skill, Craftsman and Makita.  Wore all of them out (batteries, mostly).This is the perfect combination of power and size.  It gets in to tight spots like cabinets, etc.  -And I like the new chuck.It is an excellent value. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:08:01	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

40767657	Nice machine for the $$$.  As other reviews have mentioned, the outer package doesn't hold up well in shipping.  Product came undamaged.  Set up was easy.  The machine has minimal quill runout at full extention.  Changing speeds is relativly easy.  Cuts through 1 steel with no problems.  Work table is small and sometimes difficult to clamp down a vice.  I suggest puchasing a vice after receiving the press as some vices will not fit the table.  Having been a machinist for 12 years, I am happy with the machine. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:08:01	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
46482952	The bare tool is the only way to go if you already have other DEWALT tools and batteries. The one problem is the trigger switch is the only weak link in this tool. It does not like to have the batteries inserted to hard. The contact tips will bend or break and the switch costs about $50.00 USD. Be careful if using it under a house or where foreign objects can enter the battery cavity during battery change out.  Enjoy!!!! 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:08:01	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

53034494	I totally love this tool! I was using a little Dremel for drilling and it was driving me crazy- no power. This tool is very powerful, with 5 speeds. It has made my drilling projects fast and easy. I am seriously thrilled with it!! Great product at a great price. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:08:46	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
39110225	After burning up several small diameter masonry bits (5/32#34;) using a yellow and black hammer drill and getting nowhere with the job, I saw this drill on Amazon and at the price I figured I might as well chance buying it.  The price was slightly higher than what it would cost to rent a SDS drill but I figured after the cost of driving to and from the rental store, it would be a wash.  The drill arrived when Amazon predicted it would.  I was able to drill four holes into a poured concrete floor faster than I did with the hammer drill.I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:08:46	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
47301022	So far so good.  I bought this to get to a hard to reach spot on our Volvo and it worked like a champ.  It's small in size but feels heavy and of good quality. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:08:46	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
48656184	I like the variable speed and the blower that blows the sawdust away as you saw.  I even like the no tool ability to change the blades.  Unfortunately, after less than a year owning the saw, and maybe less than a dozen uses, the knob at the top of the saw which releases the blade lock broke and I am now no longer able to change the blade.  My last jigsaw, a Craftsman, lasted over twenty years before the motor finally burned up.  They just don't make them like they used to. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:08:46	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
57454358	Just as advertised - like new, clean, works like a champ.  If you want a basic circular saw this is nicely made and I am glad I bought it. If it is all you have for cutting - you might step up and get one that has a bit more in the way of solid adjustments.  For the kind of stuff I use a hand-held circular saw for - this is perfect. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:09:30	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
48839598	Bought this for my husband and he loves it- says it almost has too much power! He's using it for home rennovations and in his shop repairing equipment. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:09:30	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
61164514	Perfect little tool for removing the many screws that hold appliances together. Small enough to fit into tight spaces and long battery life. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:09:30	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
58915784	Don't let the size of this saw fool you.  It is great for many jobs in the yard.  Much better than the gator saw from BD.  If your hedge trimmer won't cut it and you don't want to get out your chain saw this is the saw to buy. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:09:30	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
34500272	I was  quite pleased with the promptness with which this grinder was shipped and the performance on a time sensitive stage on a bath counter top removal  I was engaged in at the time.I  chose this grinder because it offered a variable speed control which i felt necessary for this current project and  future DIY's.I plan to now look more closely at other Makita products after this  positive experience. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:09:30	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

33760396	The drill came as advertised and is a wonderful tool to use.  The battery life and power is much better than any other RA Drill that I have every used before.  You won't be sorry with this drill. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:10:30	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
44213240	Arrived quicky, well packaged and in perfect conditon. I purchased this compressor to replace a senco pc1010 because I wanted a bigger air tank to reduce cycling and I liked the two large pistons on rollair to also reduce time to get back up to pressure. The senco is really a great compressor that weighs half as much as (19lbs) the rollair and is nearly as quiet.  if I have alot of trim nailing to do I grab the rollair, if I am installing cabinet trim with 18 or 23 gauge I take the senco because of the even smaller size and weight. All that being said, the rollair is a fabulous compressor with a very solid and durable frame that I am very glad that I purchased. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:10:30	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
58056769	I was a little skeptical about this saw until I plugged it in and used it!! I was able to cut a straight line with no guide thanks to the laser!! 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:10:30	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
31752097	Bought this in December '07 (it is now Jan. 2009) and have used it regularly. The batteries hold a charge like no other tool I've ever used. I just finished a day of drilling 3/4 holes in 2x6 plates and studs with this drill on a single battery that is over a year and a half old. Went all day without giving out even while drilling up to three plates thick. So impressed that I had to write this quick review. The best drill I have ever owned - period! 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:10:30	No Defect		Expert	No		false
31825330	This jigsaw is simply awesome!  Smooth, powerful, and gets the job done RIGHT.  I read some previous reviews for individuals who said this did not come with a case.  IT COMES WITH A CASE.

33045710	First things said, I am a contractor so I did use this tool somewhat, not every day but maybe once a week on average for 6-8 months. The blade change is great and the tool itself works pretty good. At issue is the battery, I went through 2 batteries and had them replaced under warranty and then the replaced batteries also died. Maybe the fact that they can be vibrated loose may have some bearing on why they fail so quickly. I would guess each battery's life was maybe a total of 4-5 actual working hours. The problem, its $50 to replace each battery on a $94 tool. Porter-Cable used to make great tools and I own many different types of their tools, but this one is a deadbeat. Buy a corded version or a different brand of cordless. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:11:10	Safety Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
35623747	I wanted an economical router for a table mount with top adjustments, but that didn't need an expensive lift.  This Triton was everything I hoped it would be. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:11:10	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
45835180	arrived on time. nice carry satchel.  I have never used a dremel set before but the blade applications table in the instruction pamphlet was pretty clear.  It worked well and my first project is a success. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:11:10	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
41535109	Great Dewalt tool at a very fair price. Kit has good selection of quick change tools. One not, tools bits can be pricey. All in all a versatile tool for doing flooring. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:12:59	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

41927038	I bought this dewalt bisquit joiner to replace the old Porter Cable model (which was (is) the worse tool I've ever purchased).  This DeWalt is the exact opposite.  Simple to operate and produces quick and effective slots for the bisquits.  The only detractor I could mention is the dust collection system is prone to clogging due to a small chute between the blade chamber and the collection bag.  Additionally, I've had some trouble getting precise orientation of the slots when using the angle fence.  Otherwise this is one of my favorite tools.  Ranks even higher than my routers.  I'd buy it again in a second. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:12:59	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
29255882	I just Love it!  Its PINK n its lite weight ...comfortable in my hand ....Did I mention its PINK...the lil screw gun works great n oh so cute...Now id like a pink circular saw!I LOVE the lil pink tool box #60;3 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:12:59	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
54870469	I bought this one during a super sale on Amazon, and I wasn't disappointed. It comes with the standard attachments, with the familiar circle of punched holes in the mounting ring. The tool is a lot quieter than the Harbor Freight one, and it also has a small fan that dissipates the heat very well (you can see the small orange circular exhaust port at the back of the tool). Vibration isn't bad, about the same as a regular random orbit sander. The tool feels pretty solid, with the aluminum head and rubber body. Other than that, it's similar to all the Craftsman/ Dremel/ Rockwell multi tools, except it's a lot cheaper. Definitely a great buy. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:26:44	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
23557426	I dont use it everyday, but I've had it for 5 years and it never failed (except once when I was using it as an icebreaker and it came apart),but it snapped backed together and kept on truckin. I always expect the batteries to die,but they go on forever!  The grip isn't very ergonomic, but I put up with it. Great deal. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:26:44	No Defect		Expert	No		false
31872986	Lets see how long it holds up. The rubber tip has gone missing already so I hope that's not an indicator of things to come. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:26:44	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
32576194	I bought this for my husband a few years ago.  He heard it was a good drill and he will concur.  He LOVES it. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:26:44	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
39930756	Purchased this nail gun to do trim work in our new house based on the reviews here. All of the reviews were right. This is a very nice tool, easy to use even for a novice like myself. It is on the heavy side, you can skip your curls at the gym after using it! (It isn't that bad) I have since purchased a DeWalt hammer drill that uses the same XRP battery pack and will be adding more tools from the DeWalt XRP line. Very pleased. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:26:44	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
45323380	Purchased to install fiber cement siding.  This is the best nailer!  I used 2 nails into studs.  Be sure to use a pressure regulator at about 90 psi and set the depth on the nailer.  Works excellent for sheeting too!  It's much lighter than others and the case is nice too. If your installing fiber cement get a pair of the gator blocks for holding and spacing the planks, they are amazing and worth every penny! 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:27:28	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
33790925	perfect combination of power and ease of use....won't do as much as the 19 amp; 24 volt models, but it also won't tire the user as much....mine finally failed after 30 months of almost continuous use...recommend highly 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:27:28	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

48729734	I bought the Delta Grinder as a gift.  It arrived on time except it was not new.  After working with the supplier and Amazon,  I am out $40 b/c I had to ship the item back.

55053307	Powerful, long lasting battery and well made.  The battery is small in size and the angle of the handle is very comfortable when using for extended time.  There are little rubber bumpers for preventing damage when layed on it's side in a rough manner.  Overall, this is a good choice in a world full of battery tools but remember, #34;You get what you pay for.#34;  All vendors have access to all parts and processes to make this tool.

57053690	I have used this rotary tool on several projects so far and haven't had any issues. The attachments it came with aren't very good imo, but the tool itself is well worth the money. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:28:17	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
25366184	It's quiet and easy to use.  Set up was a breeze.  No more ash fall while cleaning out the wood stove.

33090934	Cheap Plastic Crap that vibrated itself apart in under five minutes of very light use. Rather than waste money to send it back, I gave it to my son in law who said he could fix it but hasn't yet. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:28:17	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

50401052	I used this product for the first time to take down a fallen tree.  The Powered Handsaw did the trick.  It was so easy to use, and I felt safe using it.  I did not want a chain saw, so this was the alternative.  Very happy with this product.  As a woman over 50, I would recommend this product to anyone. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:30:14	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
25986584	This is an outstanding product that exceeds the manufacturers claims.  Dust is limited to almost nothing.  I used it for sanding after scraping popcorn off the ceiling.  If you are living in the house while remodeling, this is a must-have tool.  Of course everything depends on the two stage filtering of the attached vaccum cleaner. I have rented the tool with the Porter Cable vaccum in the past and it worked great.  I used my own vaccum with high efficiency filter and a bag and also worked great.  The sander controlled Porter Cable vaccum is a plus. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:30:14	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
56591827	I purchased this for my husbands Christmas gift because he was always borrowing people's. he said it is a great set and all of the nailers and compressor works great! I would recommend this to anyone. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:30:14	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

34458110	I've had the Makita BTD142HW-B impact driver for about a month and used it on a couple of projects. It has plenty of power for driving screws, but the variable speed trigger is a bit too sensitive for fine work. When I need muscle to drive screws, I use the impact driver. When precision is required, I use my Makita drill/driver to drive the screws. This impact driver would the perfect tool to use for building a deck! 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:30:14	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

28782024	I have used this nailer only a few times since It was delivered. It worked fine using Porter-Cable and SENCO brads that were on hand, with no jams or misfires. I am new to no-oil nailers , but like the concept and hope they last as long as a nailer that needs to be oiled!  I do wish the carry case had more storage space for brads!

48071315	Yes, it is expensive, but if you want a fast, repeatable, very sharp edge, without overheating it, get the Tormec.  I carve in slate with woodworking tools and must resharpen them often.

37986951	Shot thousands of nails as a professional tradesman. Dropped a few times from a six foot ladder and still goin' strong.

23649548	I just finished my first project cutting 18 staves for a drum I am makng out of Poplar. The saw cut through it like butter. The bevel angle setting was perfect and resulted in a perfect circle when assembled. The tilt-lock handle is very convenient. Seems to have plenty of power. The worst thing I can say is that compared to other saws that I have had, it seems to shoot sawdust everywhere. I also changed the blade to one with more teeth for a smoother cut, otherwise I am very pleased. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:42:02	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

29726261	We bought this nail gun recently on Amazon. It's been fantastic all the way. We like the Ridgid line of tools and love the lifetime warranty. This is just a heads up. The new nail gun does still have the 3 year warranty, but since it was bought on Amazon ( not an authorized dealer according to Ridgid) you won't qualify for the lifetime warranty. We thought that might be a possibility, and we still bought it. We saved enough on the price to make us happy anyway. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:43:25	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
34736814	The entire Makita 18v product line is very high quality.  The 8' 18v concrete vibrator is a good tool for small to mid sized projects.  I wouldn't consider it for large production jobs unless you needed a backup or for doing small areas in a hurry where something got missed or the rest of the crew is handling the big job.  Make sure that you have a charger and a spare battery.  Some would not list it as five stars, but I have as it is a very good tool for what it was designed for.

49927844	Bought this at the local home center, almost completely based on feel. I have big hands, but still the barrel of most grinders is too big to hold comfortably with one hand. This one is different... the barrel is smaller in diameter, giving an easier one-handed grip, and likely also safer using it this way as well. My first Makita, tool. Very impressed with the build quality so far.This is listed as a 4 grinder, but if you take the wheel guard off, I imagine you could use 4.5 attachments on it. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:44:22	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

22936479	I picked up this saw at a pawnshop for $99. Hadn't been too heavily used (it appeared to have the original Dewalt blade on it). I slapped a $17 Dewalt diamond blade on it and cut through 25 linear feet of 2cm granite with it in an afternoon. It's technically a framing saw, but it's powerful enough to work as a masonry saw.Pros: Lots of power. Better balanced (in my opinion) than most other worm-drive or sidewinder circular saws. Fairly water resistant (I was running a hose over the granite and blade while I cut, about a gallon per foot). Easy to change blades, quick-release levers for adjustments.Cons: Trigger is not very ergonomic, nor is the handle. I wear welding gloves when doing cutting, and have big hands, and there wasn't much room to spare in the grip. The trigger spring weight is very heavy and can get wearying on your finger on long cuts.Simply put, if you want a quality circular saw that's at close to professional level without having to pay exorbitant prices, this is a good bet. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:44:22	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
26484055	I have been a professional hands on custom home builder for 43 years. There are situations such as cutting electrical boxes into fine cabinetry where a slip with a 7.25 saw or distruction  of veneer with a scroll saw can ruin a project. Viewing the cut is a bit difficult and I would suggest using stops to prevent the plate from traveling past the end of cut or kicking back is worth the time. This can easily be controlled with one hand though I find performing the plunge a bit difficult. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:45:53	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

50030171	When this light weight little drill first arrived, I began to wonder if I had made a big mistake. I had owned a 12 volt Dewalt that served me for years. It was much heavier. I only decided to purchase this drill because Makitas are constantly rated so high in performance test.I must say that so far, I am VERY pleased with the performance of this drill! It is very light, yet somehow has been able to do everything I have tossed its way. I will update this as time goes on. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:46:56	No Defect		Novice	No		false

Drove a pound of 3 nails fastening 2x8 to 4x4 PT lumber and still had juice left over.

48518891	The biggest gripe it have with this is that it's too hard to secure. It has almost no extra plastic around the edges so that you can drill holes and screw it to something stable.

A lot of the great companies are selling themselves short and ruining their reputations. They will be the losers in the end because most craftsman know their tools and where they come from.

58060236	Was pleasantly surprised how well the nail gun worked. The price was reasonable and it arrived sooner than expected. I would recommend this product to anyone that uses nail guns. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:52:12	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

31423669	Very good quality. Powerful, It feels like a Makita .This is a professional tool, you won't be disappointed.Batteries are expensive, but it seems that they stay charged for ever on my other Makita drills. And the torque is there when you need it.I have been in the building trade for over 35 years and have bought and used hundreds of power tools. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:53:06	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
61491998	I purchased the Milwaukee 9081-22 14.4 volt impact after reading the Tools of the Trade test comparing all the then available tools in the 12 and 14 volt class. Up to that time I had used nothing but a 9.6 volt Makita impact that is at least 12 years old. The Milwaukee has the endurance and power to RR a 16' X 7' garage door with ease on a single battery and is tough enough to take the occasional drop from 10' or so. It recently broke down and the 5 year warranty sure doesn't hurt. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:53:06	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

24097273	Honestly this is the best Jig Saw I have owned. All the others I have owned (Including a less expensive Bosch) the blade had #34;bent#34; when cutting. This saw stopped that problem and changing the blades is crazy easy. It is a pretty beefy jig saw but if you use jig saws a lot, Hmmmm.......It rocks! 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:53:06	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
55868943	Just know the very 1st thing that u will have to do is run out and BUY SOME #34;REAL BLADES#34; These blades are almost worthless.  I do not think any of the blades are for cutting any metal or copper like shown in the pictures.  I needed to cut off the head of a screw but it cut off the tiny teeth on the blade. and made my blade look like snaggle tooth. Just get ready to spend some more money the day u use it. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:53:06	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
39474556	Excellent!  This product works right out of the box.  Light-weight, excellent power.  Might need a future re-design of the smart trigger, but on the whole a very good nailer. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:54:17	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
43478692	It seems to be good buy for the price, although the wheels are very soft and will have to be replaced shortly. They also make a big mess in the shop spraying aluminum oxide everywhere. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:54:17	Safety Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
59255326	This nailer is one of the best ones I have ever bought.The heavy weight makes it easy to use, and the hammer trigger is just the right sensitivity.I have already used it to put down flooring in a 320 sq room, used over 1000 nails, and did not have a single misfire.I can tell by feeling it that it is made well and will last a long time.It also comes with safety glasses, which is not pictured.If you need a nailer, this is the one to get. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:54:17	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
40340041	This nail gun is a great buy.  I have never used a framing nailer before and am a homeowner remodeling a basement.  First, nail guns are incredible time savers.  The last remodel I did, I nailed by hand.  I can't even express how much time and frustration this saves.  This one performis well, excellent price, has not jammed once. I am very pleased. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:54:17	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

37565918	I had to return two of these before getting one that was not broken.  Not a huge deal since Amazon is great with returns, but it does make me wonder how long it will last.

46130978	If you're looking for an entry level air hammer, but don't want to buy an off brand this tool might be a good choice for you.  I just completed replacing upper and lower ball joints on my Blazer and this 114GCQ Air Hammer worked great!.  Separating ball joints, removing rivets and cutting smaller bolts will not be a problem.

57733884	Great quality. Fast charging batteries. Very noisy though. And instead if getting slower when the battery is getting low it just suddenly stops. Definitely need the 2 batteries. Very powerful and has a fast stop clutch/brake. Highly recommend. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:56:03	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

57538553	I have used the drill a few times.  Good so far.  Very nice is the #34;no key chuck#34; feature.  The keys get lost.  Double screw driver mounted right on the unit.  Good for the money for sure.  PapaTom 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:56:03	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
56334119	It looks kinda complicated but was actually very easy to use.  It doesn't hold as tight as I wish it could, but it's plastic so I'm not trying to force it beyond its means and have it crack to pieces. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:56:03	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
57947226	Great Price for this drill! this is the new Ryobi One + drill. works very well! i been using it for the past few weeks and it's working great! i am a fan of Ryobi.love it! no problem with any Ryobi products. you have my recommendation on this drill.Note: love the bare tool. i didn't need to get the entire set for save a few bucks. i can just buy a drill without all the extra accessories that i don't need. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 01:56:03	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
34134564	I have other drills-- Porter Cable has been my company of choice. However, this Bostitch Lithium is a serious contender for my favorite. The battery is VERY light and makes things much easier on wrist fatigue. The battery holds a charge for a LONG time-- even longer than my PC tools. I don't know if that is because of the lithium factor, or because they are newer batteries, or because they are just better products. Time will tell, I guess.I also thought the charging time seemed pretty short. I know that with other battery operated tools the batteries have really deteriorated over time, so it will be interesting to see how these compare. So far, I'm impressed. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:01:00	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

41206266	Only had a chance to used it for a short time and works as it should. The price was within my budget  and the seller was great to work with in answering questions on the product. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:01:45	No Defect		Novice	No		false
30165395	The saw as delivered had the blade out of parallel with the rip guides by over .062#34;. This was non adjustable and unacceptable. Within a few days Amazon had delivered a replacement. This one had stripped threads on the fence screws which set the alignment adjustment. A call to Rockwell resulted in a new rip fence assemble. Now that the quality issues are resolved I am pleased with the saw. Amazon and Rockwell's support was commendable. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:01:45	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

52769863	I can't speak to what the reconditioned saw condition is because I bought new. This is a heavy, rugged saw w/user friendly adusting knobs. Plenty of power and makes long straight cuts easier for me than a light saw. I occassionally use it in my work and at home. I'm satisfied w/it and would recommend it to anyone who like this style saw. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:02:28	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

29956381	I concur with the reviewer that labeled this saw junk. After mapping out the room for crown, I proceeded to make my cuts. then came installation. I've hung miles of this stuff, how could I be off so much? Oh well, just go and recut. What is this? When I tighten the table knob the front end rises? My ego felt sooo much better. I've checked many since, I even showed it to a product rep. on a brand new out of the box. She was dismayed and swore to tell the people up the line. Right. But what the hey, it's your money buy one, heck get a couple for the wife and kids. It gets worse the more you use it... 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:02:28	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
43580802	Works really well, have used it for wood, metal, and dry wall. It charges quickly, has 2 battery's and plenty of power. comes with a soft black cloth bag for storage. On line I was not sure if it came with a carrying case, it does. The bag is ok for those who want to keep everything together , if you are putting it in or out of a truck...buy a black plastic case. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:02:28	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
30590105	Used to hate the cardboard boxes now it's fun to cut them up! In the winter I use the pieces to start fires in the fireplace- in summer it makes them easy to put in recycling. They work very well. Glad I got them. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:03:15	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
71814166	It isn't real clear in the product description that this vice requires a flat, 90-degree corner for installation.  Yes, you could clamp/bolt a piece of 3/4 plywood to your bench and attach this vice  to the plywood but that sure kills the convenience factor of being able to quickly use this vice ....  which is at least one reason why someone might buy a foot-operated device.And once it's installed it kind of ruins your flat workbench top, as noted by others.Based on the fact that my bench top has a front lip and even with a flat top the installation screws would hit the bench legs, I couldn't easily install this guy so I returned it.  Amazon's good about that.Amazon could prevent a lot of this type of return by including a PDF of the installation instructions on the product description page. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:03:15	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false

30483463	Bought this because I had an older, smaller version that worked well. This one stalls and has intermittent outages for seemingly no reason - my guess is either the switch is bad or the battery connection is unreliable.  It's too big and not as powerful as it's older brother that didn't have the removable battery. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:04:21	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
58708341	A well made device that has greatly decreased time needed for precision cutting and sanding.  I was surprised to see that easily cut through 10d nails and toughest wood (although it did smoke a lot).  Unlike similar devices, it is corded with 6 speeds.While I primarily bought the Sonicrafter due to a review saying it was made in Charlotte, NC, I discovered that it was only distributed from there...like everything else it is made in China.The smaller sanding paper attachment lost it's velcro due to overheating the first time I used it. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:04:21	No Defect		Novice	No		false
35874219	The battery went dead in less than 4 MONTHS -I've owned BD; products for over 50 years and this is the first product that's failed in such a short time. This drill/driver replaced a 14v one that lasted over 8.5yrs; building a utility building and numerious other projects. I don't recommend this drill and will step up to a better quality product-CGCUPDATE -BD; replaced not only the battery but the entire drill motor with a 16v,LED installed light,LITHIUM item and is two thirds the size of the old one -Look for this one- 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:04:21	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
40111860	Adjustable speed drive black box says made in Taiwan on it. Lasted less than 40 hours, glad the $915.50 item crapped out while the warranty is still in force. Waiting at least 3 weeks to get it back from a Delta Service Center where I personally delivered it to, supposed to be ready next weekend? Mid rpm range vibration also (when it runs). Long range, I am going to look for a simpler large lathe with 6 to 10 speeds, I do not need the infinite number of speeds offered by the very expensive variable speed drives, which should not be in a dusty atmosphere, like a wood lathe area! 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:05:34	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
54196949	Hubby wanted this for in the garage.Very strong pick up.Love that it has a reuseable cloth filter.For me, it was a bit difficult to close the top cause it snaps on so tightly but hubby had no problem with it.All in all, he loves it.....Would absolutely recommend it.....I may have to get me one for the house now! 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:05:34	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

54736756	This is a very interesting and fun screwdriver.  I've never seen one quite like it.  You will need to actually read the instructions to understand how to work it properly, but that takes all of 5 minutes.  DO NOT let it fully discharge or it will reduce battery life over time per Black  Decker.  I keep mine plugged in when not in use, so I cannot speak to how well it holds it's charge when not used for long periods.  So far, I'm very happy with my new neat little gadget. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:07:47	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

54725702	I got this compressor to carry with us in the motorhome.  I am surprised by how quickly the tank fills.  Topping off the air in the MH tires is fine if the tires are only down a couple psi, otherwise it's a long process because of the small volume of the compressor.  It's rather quiet and light weight.  Works fine, so far. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:07:47	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
38112280	The saw is great. It has all the power you will ever need for any wood or composite trim work. And I've used mine for very heavy work including cutting old and very dry 1 solid oak old barn floors. The stand is excellent for portable work. Although I will warn that the extensions aren't very tight, so don't count on them for a square cut. When folded the legs act as arms for a 2-person carry. Therein does lie one other criticism. It's a big large and akward for a single person. So consider a smaller saw without a stand if you work alone and have to carry it around. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:07:47	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
25846063	I read a lot of reviews before I ordered. Some good ,some bad.I received the bladerunner and tried it out . I cross cut 3/4 oak  ripped 3/4 oak very easy. I did buy different blades which made alot of difference. We used it also to install about 450 sq. ft. of laminate flooring. It cut it great. SO I would say if you want a nice small saw this is it. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:08:39	No Defect		Novice	No		false

38289959	The Bosch 36-Volt Litheon Drill/Driver is one great drill.  Plenty of speed and torque from a lightweight battery set-up.  My only complaint is that the slim pack litheon batteries have do not last as long as I would like.  I think it is because they are running such a large drill.  They are especially susceptible in cold temps (-5 Celsius and below) to shortened battery life.  Go Bosch or go home!  My previous 14.4 V Bosch Drill/Driver is ten years old and still running great except for the batteries lost there full charge capability. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:08:39	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

54516753	I purchased the cutoff saw, jig saw, and router two months ago. I got the Black  Decker model for my Sears drill!!Sears has been and still is out of the attachments.  I paid a few dollars more since the Craftsman club didn't have them. Bottom line, if you have a sears snap on, the BD; attachments work. And they work great! I have used all three in my woodworking. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:09:37	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

59635343	The low profile design of this sander makes it easier to grip and use for those of us without #34;man hands#34;It is about the same weight and has all the same quality functions, like speed control as the full size model.

50876263	I buy many reconditioned tools and buying one for Bosch- I thought I was safe.  I have used this hammer in the past so I know its a very good hammer.  However, the reconditioned hammer they gave me was far from like new.  It came with a broken handle, very dirty, and has a horrible cigarette smell.  When I am done using it I have to bring the tool outside in the garage or it will make my house smell like cigarette smoke.  I wish I paid a little more this time and got a brand new one.  You are literally rolling the dice here...  However, Bosch is a good company and after complaining I sent it back and they issued me a refund. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:11:11	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
26573397	I tried to cut a sheet of plywood with the Rotozip saw and I believe I have it assembled correctly. It kept kicking out of the wood and jumping everywhere.

27835408	This is a really good, high quality impact driver. I do highly recommend it if you do any type of work requiring it. Below are the facts of this wonderful product.The chuck only fits one size. You can't put different size drill bits in it. But that's okay because you can buy adjustments for it, which we did.There is no torque adjustment. (You have to be careful or you can break the screw off, if you are not experienced.)It doesn't have a low or high speed switch. (It does have a variable speed trigger, but it is not recommended to use it because it melts out the trigger.)It has plenty of torque (it is strong).EXCELLENT IMPACT DRIVER. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 	hyerin94	10-26-2015 02:17:41	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

42073519	I am still old school. I like corded power tools and this one is powerful enough for most #34;diy#34; projects. Not designed to drill concrete.

34788210	Awesome! I have used the corded version for a few years and this is just as good in performance and 100% more convenient. Cutting electrical conduit in a trench, in the rain, in the cold, in the dark, the last thing you want to deal with is finding somewhere to plug in a tool. I bought the kit because I like to have carrying cases for all my tools. I also bought an additional battery.

26846448	Best combo of strength and a light compact package. These feel like quality tools in your hands. In 3 years I've never met a hole it couldn't drill or a screw it couldn't drive. In fact I've broken the heads off of screws before the drill bogs down when the battery is fresh. Milwaukee Red Lithium is the king of the hill, but they are pricey and honestly overkill for homeowner DIY and armature woodworking.I can fit this drill into places my friends Ryobi tools wouldn't fit and with two batteries I can't seem to drain one battery faster than the 2nd one can charge.

39989712	I got this drill for small jobs and for use in tight spaces. It is also great for working where I have to reach far away from my body  where a normal size drill would be difficult to hold steady.  The only problem I have with it  is that the chuck does not grip a small drill well and if drilling into a 2x4 the drill slips in the chuck before penetrating the board Thus the 4 star ratiing and if the chu;ck held better it would get a 5 star rating by me. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 06:21:17	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true

27244955	i have owned three of these drills over the last seven years,i was very impressed the first time i used the 18 volt drill about five years ago and immeadiatly bought one. since that time i have noticed a serious decline in craftsmanship and customer service on DeWalt's part. the chucks spin on expensive drill bits damaging the bit,the battery packs seem to have  unreliable longievity issues. the final straw was a blown charger after approx. 40 hrs. plug in time,right in the middle of a elaborate garage remodel. i am going to start phaseing out my DeWalt cordless tools in my personal tool chest as well as the ones owned by the Parks and Recreation Dept.

46214811	This saw cuts tile like a champ.  Quick setup and easy use with very solid construction.  If the stand is not included with the saw when you buy it, make sure to buy that also, it is a must-have.  My only other experience with a wet tile saw was with the el-cheapo model from [local store], there is no comparison between that saw and the MK-660.  The only reason I didn't give this saw 5 stars is because it did not include a fence for making diagonal cuts.  In a higher-end saw such as this, I would have expected that this relatively inexpensive accessory would have been included. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 06:26:19	No Defect		Novice	No		true

43386555	This folding table set is an essential accessory for the DeWalt 735 planer. Without it it is really difficult to feed the boards straight into the planer, avoiding the snipe (uneven finish at the front and back edge of the board being planed).The build quality is high, installation easy. Make sure you adjust the tables after installation to be exactly level with the planer's table. This is easily done (see instructions enclosed w. the accessory).In principle you could build a wooden in-feed / outfeed table yourself, but it would be difficult to make it exactly co-planar with the planer's table, and it would probably cost more than this product.Sometimes the planer actually comes as a package with these tables and spare set of knives (check prices).Amazon delivered the product quickly. No issues. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 06:27:33	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

51748812	I've used this twice, and really, for the price, it's a nifty little tool. I had originally looked at the peticure, but read reviews about the battery not lasting long, plus it costs twice as much. Thought I'd try this and it works great-especially if using rechargeable batteries. I know I didn't want a cord, and the batteries in a rechargeable unit will eventually wear out. This is great-if it runs down, you can pop in charged batteries and it keeps going.I'm sure you can pay twice as much and get a better unit, but at least for me and my little chihuahua/terrier, this one does the job. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 06:28:41	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

The only reason I give it 3 stars instead of 5 is the safety switch.  It is a pain to operate out of the box.  I had to file it down to use it, now it works fine.  Milwaukee has a similar switch on their small angle grinders that is just as effective and works much smoother.  I would not buy this grinder again because off the switch.

60338069	I have been a remodeler/carpenter for twenty-five years,so I fully intend to use this miter saw almost daily. I was looking for dependability, consistant cut quality, and of course value. I really don't need a slider type or dual compound capability, perhaps if I had these functions I would grow to appreciate them too. The PC/Delta miter saw is not light weight, but it is very stable and the rubber pads on the feet make it more so. My first project was to make my version of the 2x4 saw table that the manual shows[the base is designed to sit in it], it has since cut a variety of trim. The saw needed no tweaking, I was satisfied with the accuracy out of the box. I had no trouble assembling the extension table and fence slide. The table rotated easily on mine but was stiff on a couple that I tried at stores. It is adjustable like almost every feature. With daily use the saw will need some adjusting as it wears from use and gets banged around in the van. One feature that is not common with the Delta is the bevel scale which is stainless steel on the PC and much easier to see for me. I had been using a Dewalt CMS and it gave me good service and is very worn now. I thought of going with another one, but I was intrigued by the dual laser thing. I am becoming more far sighted and it is getting harder to see in dimmly lit situations [like when you work under temporary lights and spotlights]. So I thought what the heck and gave it a try. I have found it helpful. I put a 80t Freud on her and she does a good job. By the way that 2x4 saw table works real good and is cheaper and lighter than the metal type[$10.00 in 2x4 material].All in all I am very pleased. Its a battleship, rock solid construction. I think it will hold up to whats ahead. I was fortunate to find one at a closeout sale for the same price as the Delta. There seems to be about a fifty dollar difference between the two-is it fifty bucks more for the name or the color? One twist is that Delta gives a two year warrenty and PC one.Thumbs up from Ohio! 	rgruss	10-26-2015 06:36:00	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

43969020	This is a fantastic saw.  The manufacturer's comments say it all, but the most important thing they mention is the lower guides.  Having these guides close to the underside of the bottom of the table allows for tight turns and better tracking on straight cuts.  The competition doesn't have this type of guide -- only Delta.Also, this saw has a super-heavy trunnion underneath it -- heavier than the quot;you know who'squot; saw with it's aluminum trunnion.If you are interested in doing some resawing, get the riser kit.  Then, pair the saw up with some of those low-tension Swedish steel blades that are so popular and you can run a 3/4quot; blade on it with no problem.  I don't think the saw would properly tension a 3/4quot; blade unless you seek out these low tension blades, however.  With the riser kit and these blades, this is a fantastic saw for resawing, and it's made even better by the super-adjustable features of the fence that's included.I've done a lot of cutting on my saw, and I'm extremely pleased with it.  Unless you're prepared to spend nearly twice as much, I don't think you'll beat it! 	rgruss	10-26-2015 06:38:29	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

The plastic cover to the control box was cracked upon opening due to the heavy thing shifting around in the box during shipping, but nothing else was bent or broken.Works well, can run 2 hoses, controls are tight and precise. The starter switch/wire is a little weird and not really crisp when moving to the on/off position, but it seems to be fine.The sheet metal that hold the gauges is a little thin.

46853354	Don't get me wrong - the drill is GREAT. The problem is the battery - if you don't use them on a regular basis, they lose their charge - forever. Milwaukee has a manual on how to jump start dead batteries, but it's a half-baked solution. The truth is, NiCad batteries from Milawaukee are seriously flawed for the occasional user. Probably great for a tradesman.I have a similar Porter Cable drill - the drill itself is junk compared to the Milwaukee. But, the batteries have lasted forever. Not sure what the difference is, but buyer beware. I'd suggest going to the Lithium Ion models. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 06:52:21	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true

40841379	I like this drill for many very good reasons, but it is also very frustrating for a lot of good reasons.It has really good torque, I have rarely had to grab my corded drill because I needed more power.-But the brushes still give off an ozone odor a year after I bought it and I've remodeled a kitchen with it so it's hard to believe they aren't seated yet.The batteries charge really fast.-But after a little more than a year they started failing.  After a year and a half one is completely shot, the second is almost worthless.It has a lifetime warranty-But the nearest service center is over an hour from my house, and if I ship it they will only pay for return shipping.  I also have to ship the entire kit (batteries, charger, and drill) even if the only concern I want addressed is the batteries.Would I buy it again?  I don't know.  I'm going to give it another shot, get the batteries replaced and see how it goes.  If I find myself in the same position in another year and a half then I'll probably e-bay it and buy something with a less impressive warranty. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 06:52:21	Safety Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true

30534592	If you're looking for the best portable table saw, here it is.  I've used my boss' Bosch portable saw for seven years or so, and I love it, but this one is even better.  This saw is very similar to the Bosch portable as far as quality, engineering, and features.  The Makita is just bigger and badder!  It's heavier too, but you'll have to deal with it, because if you want precision, longevity, and efficiency, you're going to want this saw.  I just looked at the DeWalt portable at the store too, and I can tell you that it has some nice features, but if you want something you'll have forever, the Makita 2705 is your saw (and you do want your saw forever!)  I bought the Makita 2705 never having seen it before, because I can't find one locally.  I trust Makita wholeheartedly, and I'm glad I did.  Most of my stuff is Makita because they not only have a reputation for quality, but their tools are just damn fun to use, comfortable, and user friendly.  My local tool shop owner stands by their stuff too, and he urged me to check it out.  You can forget about the negative reviews on this saw, because Makita must have fixed the fence problem since then.  I don't know what the old one was like, but this saw comes with the best rip fence I've seen in a tie with Bosch's.  If you don't know already, the rip fence is an ESSENTIAL part of the saw.  It's what makes the saw accurate.  It's one major reason you need a table saw in the first place.  The Makita fence (like Bosch's) is a strong, sturdy, single piece of aluminum tubing basically, which means it's stronger than most other fences like DeWalts', which is a flimsy L shaped aluminum piece with only two sides to get strength from.  Makita's rip fence slides smoothly across the nice, flat table.  The Makita has a great, precise magnifying lens to view your ripping measurements (like Bosch's.)  This saw is a little larger and certainly more powerful than Bosch's, with a higher RPM.  The Makita is the only 10 inch table saw I know that can rip all the way through 4x material in one pass. That is a huge feature in itself.  The table extension extends very smoothly and squarely, just like you want it to.  It has two locking levers that function solidly.  The rip measurements are easy to read; made on nice metal plates, recessed in the metal slide so they won't wear off.  The blade height adjustment wheel has a nice feel and sturdy sound to it when you raise and lower the blade.  Nice feel and sound to the on/off switch as well; easy to use even with gloves on.  The bevel adjustment lock is basically the same as Bosch's too, which is the best on the market.  Although the Makita requires you to turn the bevel adjustment wheel to adjust bevel angle, instead of just pushing the bevel mechanism like Bosch's.  Both brands features have their pros and cons in the bevel department.To use this saw on the job, I bought the Bosch gravity rise stand, because it's the best, fastest, strongest, and easiest to use of the ones I've seen.  I tried the DeWalt one (which is light and portable, but flimsy), and I can tell you the Bosch is better hands down in quality, strength, and ergonomics. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 07:10:06	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

55811912	As a proffesional contractor who relies on my tools to feed my family I have to say this tool is a winner.  I was introduced to it by a finish carpenter who had been using one he got as a gift.  It has almost replaced my regular heavy 18v drill.  the hex bits work great, but beware of breaking them easily.  Also the hex drill bits can not be resharpened easily.  Between this tool and the Dewalt 7.2v screwdriver, I have gone from using my big 18v drill daily to less than weekly.  I love this tool for setting and removing tapcon screws in concrete!!! nothing is better!!  I also discovered that by placing a soft brass rotarly brush in it, it is a wonderful tool to cleen off wood, concrete, and sidding.  I used to have my assistant clean the concrete splatters off of sidding until I discovered this.  Now instead of taking the better part of a hour to clean a porch, it is done in less than 10 minutes and usually less than 5.  Time is money and this tool saves time in a big way.  The only major downside is the cost of hex accesories and the quality of them.  You will definitely get what you pay for in them, so don't scrimp and buy the cheapies.  Especially screwdriver bits, they break too easy and you'll just end up going through them faster.  I highly recomend using square drive screws with this tool. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 07:12:27	No Defect		Expert	No		true

40703358	Alright, changed my review to one star after more extensive use.The drill itself is designed ok.  The bubble level is handy, the trigger is responsive and it's easy to control the speed based on how hard you press it. The drill feels solid enough.There are a number of problems that should steer you away from drill to a nicer drill though. At this price some corners have been cut.First, the drill doesn't generate that much power.  For the smaller gauges it works fine, but for the larger bit size (1/4 inch) if struggles to generate enough torque to get though tougher materials.  For drywall, using the screwdriver type attachments, and soft woods its probably ok, but forget it for any harder wood or getting anything really tight, you can generate more power with your hand.  Based on this, I'd recommend a nicer cordless drill, or a corded drill.Second, the drill bits are not labeled, had to compare them against a friend's and mark down the approximate sizes with a marker.Lastly, you can't use the drill without charging the battery, there's no way to directly plug it into a power source.  If you haven't used the drill in a while and the battery has lost it's charge, you'll have to wait to charge the battery, or if the battery runs out, you'll have to wait.  If the battery goes out your out of luck.  This would hamper the ability to do extended work with the drill. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 07:18:28	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true

54593287	I got a beat up oily box like everyone else.  The box is pretty big and heavy, so not the easiest of items for UPS to handle.  That being said, the item still works with no leaks (oil or air).  My only complaints so far is that the air filter provided does not fit.  I may call Cal Air Tools and ask if I got the wrong one. Also the oil drain (which is the sight glass) is impossible to loosen as it is recessed and a 7/8#34; socket does not fit.  I am not sure how to remove the oil, I may siphon it off.The item is semi-quiet.  Not sure why so many have complained about the noise.  It is definitely much quieter than belt driven compressors.I did buy this from Amazon Warehouse, so it may have been used already. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 07:18:28	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
41277944	The cost of this small compressor is significantly higher and a good compressor can be bought for half the price.

It is not ultra quite, but it is significantly quieter than any other model I have looked at and it performs very well.

44566112	This almost set my house on FIRE!!! I got this to replace the charger I had for my 12V firestorm drill batteries I've had since about 2005. I plugged in my battery to charge it on the new charger and about 3-5 minutes later, I started to smell a very strong chemical burning odor. The new charger was smoking and when I unplugged and took the unit outside to examine it.  The charger's plastic was bubbled, blistered and smoking hot. I am so lucky I didn't plug this in and leave my house-- I might not have a house if I did.  There are other options for replacement chargers on Amazon, I'd recommend to look at those and read the reviews!  I wish I had! 	rgruss	10-26-2015 07:21:12	Safety Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true

53910740	I have been a remodel contractor for 30+ years .  I recently bought the Bosch MX25EK which is so-so in my opinion.  It is underpowered for a contractor except for occasional use.  The cost of the blades far exceeds their value and they wear out quickly often lasting only one or two cuts.  At $10+ for blades, use a reciprocating saw when you can. Sometimes, the size and action of the Bosch makes it worthwhile for those hard to get to places.  A handpowered, undercut saw, works faster for door trim.  It works well as a detail sander.  If you think you are going to be using it a lot, either buy a Fein, or the more expensive, heavy duty Bosch. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 07:22:23	No Defect		Expert	No		true
38875615	There are already about half a million reviews on this tool, so I'll keep mine short and sweet. This thing ROCKS. Especially for it's size.I have the 5 piece Dewalt 20v Max kit and use the crap out of it and it continues to impress me, but the hammer drill/driver and to a point the impact driver are a bit chunky and heavy, so I went on a search for something more compact. Seeing as how the 20v max charger will charge the 12v battery, buying this seemed like a no brainier. I bought both the 12V MAX Impact Driver and the 12v MAX Drill/Driver. Both are very lightweight, built well and perform flawlessly. I tested the impact driver with a variety of screws and lag bolts and to be quite frank, it surprisingly drove everything the 20v MAX impact driver did, albeit a bit slower and with about half the runtime.Also worth noting, these are actually 10.8 volt tools (Like all the rest of the subcompact tools available). Like other companies, Dewalt has fallen in-line and started going with MAX ratings. Meaning the batteries are only 12 volts when not under load. Audio companies have been doing this for years, so I guess it was only a matter of time before tool manufacturers started this practice. But don't let the rating fool you...They perform like nothing I've ever seen for this size and weight.NOTE: Amazon has this listed as 79 inch pounds of torque. This is a mistake. Its actually 79 FOOT pounds, which equates to 948 inch pounds. And I believe every word of it.This is a great feeling tool. Very balanced. I used the Milwaukee M12 for about a day and couldn't wait to stop using it. It's top heavy and the battery doesn't compensate enough which causes wrist fatigue fairly quickly.The only negative I have found is the FWD, REVERSE switch feels a little loose and spongy. It hasn't been a problem thus far, so hopefully there won't be any trouble.All-in-all, I am VERY pleased with this Impact Driver (along with it's drill/driver brother) and highly reccomend to anyone looking for a powerful, yet compact cordless driver. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 07:22:23	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

51132185	I originally purchased this not because I thought my Dremel was inadaquate or that this would somehow be better, I purchased it because Proxxon's drill press is far superior to the one made by Dremel.  However, now that I have it, I never use my Dremel for anything anymore.  The Proxxon isn't necesarilly any more powerful, but it is dramatically quieter and somewhat easier to handle than my Dremel.  It even uses all my old Dremel bits.  The price is comparable to a similar model Dremel.  Unless you want a drill press, I wouldn't go throwing out your old Dremel, but if you are in the market for something new, Proxxon is the way to go. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 08:18:02	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

This thing will perform any household tasks with power and battery life to spare.

49642448	I can't say enough good things about this saw that haven't already been said by all the other 5 star reviews.  This saw is better than its DeWalt competition. I've used the DeWalt many times and the Bosch is a smoother cutting saw, quieter, and easier to use.  The fence is excellent and locks in place square to the blade every time.  There is much less vibration than other saws resulting in super clean cuts, good enough for fine finish work without a lot of extra sanding.  The Gravity rise stand is awesome! It is well worth it for any aging carpenter having to move a saw around. It will add years of life to your back for sure.I've had mine about a year and a half and it is holding up to job abuse extremely well.  I love this saw!  I got the saw on sale from a retailer and saved big money too.Makita has come out with a similar model saw and is bound to give the Bosch some competition but it is still over $600 at pro lumber yards and I didn't think it had as good of a stand. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 08:21:19	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

30911461	My existing grinders all run about 10,000 RPM. This grinder is compact and runs at 4500 RPM (so it won't overrev the pads), and has a standard 5/8-11 grinder thread. Very light weight and comfortable. Comes with a guard, screw-in side handle and an extra set of brushes. Motor is not labeled. Can't use the guard when polishing, but it's there nonetheless.Comes with seven, 4 diameter Velcro-backed polishing pads that attach to a supplied adapter that screws onto the grinder:50 grit -- rough cut if surface is really rough100 grit -- rough cut200 grit -- start with this if surface is already smooth; will remove big scratches400 grit -- removes small scratches800 grit -- surface should shine after this pad1500 grit -- using pads above 800 should be done after application of densifier (see below); surface should reflect now3000 grit -- final finish. If done right, it says the stone should look wet.There are three different adapters available, depending on the surface shape. Some are flexible, others are rigid. The adapter that came with the kit is sort of both -- semi-rigid.Per the info sheet, all dry grinding steps should use a light, circular motion, like waxing a car with a buffer. New diamonds appear on the pads as they wear down.Applying too much pressure will throw off diamonds before their useful life is over. Also, too much pressure will build up too much heat and melt the rock surface. Not good, apparently. One reason most polishing is done with water cooling.More info at [...]It says dry polishingis very aggressive and needs a light touch and under-5000 RPM speeds, unless (per instructions) polishing softer limestone such as marble or travertine you'll need to run the pads at lower speed or add soapy water to the surface to avoid color transfer.Will give it a try to edge polish a small granite slab after I cut the slab to size.It also comes with two bags of powder. The larger bag is the densifier. Per the included info sheet around 11 oz of this sugar-like powder is mixed with a quart of deionized or purified drinking water and becomes corrosive -- wear gloves and eye protection. It can be stored in a heavy duty polyethylene (PE) bottle. I assume you need to keep all metal away for long term storage. No metal jar caps.The other smaller pouch of chalky powder is for filling pores and top curing. A gallon of solution is made up adding just a teaspoon of this powder to a gallon of tap water, letting the solution settle, and then using only the clear solution on top, adding more water as needed.The densifier is squeegeed onto the surface and allowed to set overnight under a plastic cover so it won't dry out as it forms a gel. The plastic dropcloth keeps CO2 out during the process and to keep it damp. The gel bonds with the aggregates and hardens the surface so a higher sheen can be achieved.The other solution is used to fill in gaps and will bond with the densifier.Obviously, there's more to polishing granite than meets the eye. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 08:32:28	No Defect		Expert	No		true

31852525	This grinder has turned out to be the most handy and useful tools I've purchased in this line of Makita tools.  I find myself reaching for this tool more than I ever did my corded version, simply because it's so capable and nimble since there's no cord to deal with.  Most of my use is for sharpening lawnmower blades, deburring metal or grinding down welds and it works great.  I  sharpened 5 mower blades (pretty heavy ginding) on one battery.  Granted, this tool drains batteries the quickest of all the LTX tools I have, but I expected as much from a tool doing this kind of labor.  If I had to come up with a down side to this tool.....I guess havening a trigger instead of a slide switch would be nice, and maybe having it with variable speed would be nice too incase I wanted to sand of buff with it, but I'm not complaining at all.

The compressor has two connectors that allow simultaneous operation of air tools using two hoses.The nailers (16-gauge finish nailer, 18-gauge brad nailer, and narrow-crown stapler) are good quality and worked well. The instructions suggest putting 4 or 5 drops of air tool oil in the air inlet coupler before each use.

40767667	As a small fellow, I bought this primarily because it was so light.  It is certainly easier to handle.  However, you do have to hold it strongly with both hands.  It develops so much torque and has so little mass to resist, kickback is definitely more of a problem than with my old Sears Craftsman.  I've experienced it climbing up the workpiece and running backwards across it, particularly with a narrow kerf blade like that intended for plywood.That said, if held securely, it's a very good saw.

34952445	It is my fault that I own this tool. I left it parked in my Amazon wish list while I made up my mind about it. Long story short, my wife saw it there, ordered it from Amazon and got it for me for Christmas. Now don't get me wrong, I am very appreciative of the gift and will actually use the tool extensively until it, like it's VP730 predecessor goes to that great toolbox in the sky. I just want everyone to know what they are buying. My degree in Industrial Design from Georgia Tech means I am supposed to know what I am talking about here.I was pursuing this search to replace an aging and failing Black and Decker VP730. I have had the 730 for many years and it has served me well. I also have several of the VersaPak batteries common to both tools. My worst complaint about the 810 is the hinged pistol grip. That one design feature cascades and causes several other problems. First, the function of a pistol grip is to supply leverage (moment arm) in controlling the torque generated in a rotary device. It also makes it possible to apply more pressure in driving a screw through harder materials due to the ergonomics of the human hand. Neither the 810 or the 730 develop the level of torque necessary to need this feature. And if you are driving screws into very hard material like oak, you probably will want to go with a larger tool anyway. This one wrong design decision makes the 810 almost 1 1/2#34; longer and a 1/4#34; greater in diameter. This decreases the tight spaces the tool can be utilized in and makes it not as comfortable as the 730 in my size medium hands. Surprisingly the increase in size did not result in an increase in weight. This is not a good thing as it indicates the tool is made of lighter/flimsier materials and will probably not give the service life of my 730.Pros:Uses the VersaPak batteriesOrange color makes it easier to find when you lay it down in a dimly lit workspace.Will supposedly fulfill the functions of a VP730Torque setting increase from 6 to 24Cons:Useless hinged pistol gripHinge is an additional failure point in the designBigger in all dimensionsTorque settings increase from 6 to 24. This is overkill as they are not calibrated in any way, form or fashion.Made in ChinaFinal comment; clean up your Amazon wish list prior to the Christmas Season or your birthday. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 09:00:10	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		true

56457600	I have to admit,I've always been one of those pro carpenters that thought DeWalt saws looked and worked cheaply. Like many of you, I have used every chop saw and dual compound miter saw imaginable. Years later I became a woodshop teacher. When I started, the old teacher before me had an nice new Makita and good old Hitachi stuffed in the back tool storage room and this saw set up prominently out on the shop floor. I decided to leave it there and see what would happen over the course of the school year.I watched this saw get day in and day out abuse from students who cut too fast, started the saw while touching the work, let the saw run too long, let the saw snap back to its upright position, chopped wood not against the fence, never cleaned the blade or used wicked dull blades all day. I had students using pine and the saw covered in sap that hardened to amber. (hey I can hear you judging me fellas, I had thirty-two inner city kids in these classes [no injuries-knock on wood]. One week I had students blazing away for hours chopping hickory and pecan, leaving the saw hot to the touch.Long story short: you couldn't find a better field testing environment than a high school shop class. Despite this merciless abuse, this saw cut perfectly accurate. It is loud, and the brake doesn't like the kind of resharpened heavy blades I use, but nonetheless, after school, I made fine furniture with this same saw. I made tight perfect miters with it It could chop cleanly through 12/4 rock maple full of nails on a dull blade (I know all of you are wincing, that's why I used a beater blade)I used it to chop and cut shoulders on giant 5 in dovetails in 8/4 Bubinga. or trimming off a 64th of the same without it drifting away...always leaving my work dead on 90 degrees. We cut dirty two by fours, weird laminates, acrylic, you name it, this saw performed.This proves to me that this saw has earned it's chops for the jobsite. Period. I wish I could say the same about DeWalt biscuit joiners. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 09:00:10	No Defect		Expert	No		true

26219980	This drill is a heavy duty model designed for applications that are too tough for battery operated models and most other corded drills.  I have used mine for drilling into railroad ties, landscape timbers and support posts while building retaining walls, decks and patios.  I have also used it for auguring 3x12 holes for planting bulbs in my flower beds.  It has never once overheated or failed to perform, and the price offered by this vendor made it an outstanding value. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 09:03:26	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
43705334	My wife got me this for christmas 2 years ago, and it still works great.  I use the drill quite frequently, and the saw a few times a year.  Sometimes I think the battery life could be better, but that could just be me being picky.  Other than that, it's great.  Great product, interchangeable battery packs and charger work great.  This has completed many jobs around my house and crafts.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a new cordless drill or circular saw (or both). 	rgruss	10-26-2015 09:03:26	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

50301626	I bought this drill to replace my cheap old Black  Decker which had finally bit the dust after about 12 years (pretty good for a $30 Chinese drill). I bought it because it seemed nice, powerful, and Assembled (not MADE) in USA.As soon as I went to test it, though, I noticed a lot of run out in the chuck.I did a little drilling, and it seemed to work fine, although it did emit a rather high pitched whine from the motor.I switched to Hammer Mode, and it started to turn, then stuck, and smoked.I took it back, and switched back to an el cheapo Chinese made Black  Decker. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 09:04:32	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
54647045	I do a fair amount of repair of scientific equipment. Manufacturers build their instruments to last forever, and use some sort of thread locking material on every stinking nut and bolt they install.  Often I have limited space to work, and I can only schlep around so many tools at once.The Milwaukee M12 Cordless 12V 3/8 Impact Tool is an excellent example of the progression and application of lithium ion technology, creating super-strong and super small-tools, that entered the market three to four years ago. My overall impression is that this impact driver fits a niche that other manufacturers have seemingly overlooked.I use a variety of cordless compact LiIon impact driver tools.  In reading the accompanying review of the Milwaukee 3/8 M12 Impact Driver, I was concerned about the reviewer's critique of the tool's wimpy torque factor, as in inch/pounds (in/lbs) rating.  The reviewer expressed how underwhelmed he was when trying out the 2451-20.  For reference, I first looked at the advertised in/lbs rating of the Bosch 12V Max LiIon Impactor, and the manufacturer states a maximum rating of 800 inch/lbs of torque. I then checked the same factor for the Milwaukee 2451-20 and Milwaukee claims a maximum torque of 1000 in/lbs, which would suggest 20% more torque than the Bosch Impactor.I suppose there is some sort of graphic curve one can refer to or plot out as to what the maximum torque force one could elicit using a 12V LiIon cell and motor. It would be the same old argument about how many horsepower (hp) one can get our of a motor wired to 110V.  I suppose through mechanical leverage, a manufacturer might be able to reduce friction and inefficiency, but folks, 12 volts is only 12 volts!So, having several M12 tools such as he mini Hacksall, the right angle drill, copper tube cutter, the M12 radio and several of the M12 flashlights, batteries and chargers, including the cool dual voltage 110V/12V model, I opted for a bare Milwaukee 2451-20. I also purchased the 3/8 to 1/4 driver adapter so I could use my collection of 1/4 hex bits too.  I rounded out my Milwaukee purchase with the Milwaukee 3/8 deep socket set. Without a doubt, I am very pleased with my investment and would heartly refer my friends and co-workers to purchase the same product.I am a HUGE fan of Bosch tools.  Having said that, I'd like to point out the single competitive advantage that the Milwaukee 2451-20 3/8 M12 driver has over the Bosch 12V Max Impactor, is the fact that there is more metal used to build the square drive socket holder. I have broken so many bits, nutdrivers and adapters with the Bosch Impactor, because I am asking an awesome tool to do a big job with a bit that has a 1/4 hex shank.In summary, because there does not appear to be a viable alternative at this time in the compact 3/8 12V LiIon impact driver realm, I believe Milwaukee offers a unique utility tool. Milwaukee by all accounts has decided to invest heavily developing other novel tools with the same 12V battery platform, and this one is a beauty, eh? Plus, 20% more torque,so says Milwaukee.I love it. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 09:04:32	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

25481858	I bought this set for about 2 weeks.A new version to replace LXT600 / LXT700 (both were retired). Look at the spec and here's the difference:1. BHP452 maybe less powerful than BHP451 (just by spec; I don't own BHP451 to compare);2. BSS611 is 0.2 lb lighter than BSS610; (Dewalt circular saw blade (18 tooth) made finish smoother in this set.)3. BJR182 is 1.875 shorter than BJR181 and w/o the LED front light;4. BTD141 has 50 in-lbs Torque more than BTD140 (I don't like the cheap silver plastic at the body, but not enough to make me deduct a star from this set);5. DC18RA 30 minutes rapid charger vs old DC18SC 45 minutes charger.Forget the LXT700, you don't want to pay $100 more for a on-site radio. You can have it free through rebate if you bought this set on/before 5/31/08.I rather Makita offered an extra battery (even it's cheaper), but there is no choice. As another reviewer pointed out MP3 is a better choice.You can still go to LXT600 to see all the users' reviews.Best price/quality/size/weight/completion comapre with other brands like Dewalt, Milwaukee, Ridgid (no cordless grinder), Bosch, etc.Prefect if Maikta replace the flashlight by a Jig Saw. Every brands practice to make money/looks better by placing a flashlight in their combos. What can I said...I used to own Dewalt DC4PAKA combo kit but found the Ni-cad battery didn't last long so returned it and decided to go Lithium-ion.IMO Dewalt quality is excellcent but the weight (me not a big guy) and price is too heavy; Milwaukee just too heavy and I don't like its hand-feel. Ridgid has lifetime service guarantee (including battery) but I'm not sure the quality of both tools and service. Tools look and feel good in HD but offer no cordless grinder.So far every tools included are doing their job as what they suppose to. Again I compare this set with Dewalt Ni-Cad 4 pc combo set, not any other cord/cordless tools.One LXT600 reviewer said the recipro saw is a pc of junk. I don't know but for me it did what Dewalt recipro saw capable to, only the weight is much lighter.However, I did extended research before my decision and much appreciate opinions from all reviewers. 	rgruss	10-26-2015 09:14:17	No Defect		Expert	No		true

29450344	it's exactly what i was looking for and there are a couple of things other consumers need to know ... 1. the plug- in charger is small, so keep an eye out for it.....it plugs into the back of the handle...2. this drill has NO charger indicator anywhere on it, so when you plug it in, be mindful of how long you've had it on the charger and DO NOT keep it plugged in constantly or you'll kill the battery fast. other than that, it's very stable, very well constructed and it CAN handle some heavy work!! try 1/2 inch steel with a titanium drill bit...chewed thru it like a fat man at an all you can eat buffet!! i'm very happy with this product and for what it lacks in lights, it makes up for in raw power. all the of scrunity reviews that a lot of people have submitted thus far for what it can and can't do?...listen, i've been a tradesman for going on 20 years and have toolboxes taller than anyone reading this and i can assure you, if this product was worthless, i would most definitely give it the heave. if you're on a budget or are looking for a good replacement for your old beat up 12-volt, this is a great start and it WILL get the job done, but be mindful, EVERY portable tool has it's limitations..as does DeWalt, Makita, Craftsman, Snap-On, Mac or any other toolmaker's products. use the right tool for the right job and you'll be amazed at just how long it will last. overall, great product in an economical package! now go buy some stuff!! 	rgruss	10-26-2015 09:15:57	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

36215166	I have owned one of these for about three years now and I have no complaints at all. It really shines when a large 18v is more drill than you need but you don't want to be handicapped by a lack of power. The charger gets the batteries charged up quickly and the whole package is very portable. Ridgid offers a Lifetime Service Agreement which covers every component, including your batteries, so as long as you are careful and hang onto your receipt, or register the tools with Ridgid, you'll never have to worry about needing to buy new batteries when they run out of life. I can testify to the LSA because I just had both batteries replaced and the only thing I had to do was take them (along with the drill  charger) down to a local service center and within a week I had two new batteries. I can't ask for anything better from a company. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:05:10	No Defect		Expert	No		false

45887742	I am a plumber and am used to cutting my PVC pipe w/ a good o'l cordless Sawzaw.  Thought I'd give this tool a shot to save me from cleaning up the shavings and cutting perfectly straight.  I just used the tool for the second time on a repair and the tool cut great on the first cut but on the second cut it basically shattered the 2 PVC Foam Core. Mind you I was in a tight place on the second cut and couldn't give the tool a little twist as I was beginning the cut. Ended up using the Sawzaw to clean up the mess. Also, the safety is cumbersome especially when switching from cut to retract which mind you does not happen automatically.  You must power the shear open for a sec. before you can hit the quick release lever. It's probably good that the safety is a pain, otherwise the tool would be very dangerous.  But if you did start to cut into an appendage, you would have to switch it to reverse, push the safety, then drop the tool and call 911.  I think I would like the tool better if it defaulted to the open position at all times when you release the trigger. I would give it all five stars if it didn't shatter my PVC pipe.  Other than that it does cut a perfectly clean and straight cut so maybe use it when roughing in or when shattering pipe isn't such a problem like in a repair situation were you kinda need to be left with some usable pipe to make the connections proper. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:15:38	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

54730556	Being a user of Delta amp; Porter Cable products and builder of cabinets and fine furniture, once again, Delta's reputation of quality machinery stands true.  I found the pre adjustments made at the factory were on target with no adjustments needed on my part.  I broke the machine in starting with maple, walnut and oak milling down from 34quot; to 1/2quot; with no trouble and no sniping worth talking about.  The finish was smooth as glass.  However, I do recommend that you should purchase the vac attachment for the planer as you will build a mountain of chips that would put a beaver to shame.  I have the planer hooked up to a shop vac which does the job with little effort and the area is clean after planing.  If you are looking for quality work with simplicity in operating, you can't go wrong with the Delta 13quot; planer. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:22:29	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
60979032	bought this for my husband as a birthday gift and he loves it, battery seems to last long enough to do little handy man projects around the house.

38304035	I purchased this drill press from Amazon and it came in perfect condition. It is heavy and I needed a helper to assemble it. It runs great and is not noisy if the belt tension is set properly--not too tight. The other drill presses in this price range do not have the same great features, such as: (1)Deep plunge ability, you won't need to adjust the table as often.(2) A fast action nut on the depth gauge to quickly and acurately set the depth.(3) A hold-down feature set with a small knob to check location and depth of hole to be drilled. I have had other drill presses but none have had these features. I purchased the light seperately which is far better than a built-in light,you can put the light on the work. Amazon forgot to send the mortising attachment, but after an E-mail it was sent. For the furniture maker or small shop you can't do better than this without jumping into the [higher] price range. I love it! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:22:29	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

44812717	I wanted one of these for a while to get into those tight spaces my drill driver wont go. It works great for that purpose. It wont be my most used tool for drilling or driving because the reverse button is harder to get to than my drill driver. That was the only thing that slowed me down. I also had a little trouble putting as much pressure on the screws. The bit poped out of the screw head very easy. This is a super strong tool and does the job like the 18v drill driver. Another good tool by Dewalt. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:30:35	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

40277268	Accurate, no wobble, and the oscillating sanding drum feature is very handy.  A good price for what you get - lots of power.  However the build quality is not great - some sharp edges to cut yourself on.  The clamps for the table are particularly good at pinching your fingers - I've drawn blood from pinches and bangs using this press twice. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:30:35	Safety Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
43340572	If there is a better designed and performing tool .... I don't own it just yet.  This tool performs impeccably, and my only regret is not having purchased it sooner.  However, I should add that I do take exceptional care of my tools, and clean/maintain them as needed.  I'm sure that if I did not maintain the tool as required, abused it, flung it into the back of a truck with no case, and used out of date fuel cells, I could probably replicate some of the complaints posted here.  But since I do treat my tools with care, I have experienced absolutely zero failures, misfires, etc.  Maybe I just got lucky. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:30:36	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
59924516	This saw is a real time saver.I own a table saw as well as a mitre saw,but for floor installation,having this portable saw right next to work area is great!No more hauling around the big stuff for me!Saw switches easily from cutting to ripping,plenty of power,and a much better build quality than many similar products. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:30:36	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
37392880	My boyfriend had this set and I was helping him work on our bicycles to tighten gears, etc. I fell in love with the ease of use that this set provides.Boyfriend left his tool set on the boat, and out in the rain, gradually lost the screwdriver bits, and the tools became rusty and icky. Still totally functional though. (minus the bits gone AWOL).Now i am a girly girl, but I'm also pretty handy. So I decided I wanted the same tool set of my own, for when boyfriend and I move in together. I didn't trust him not to lose or #34;mistreat#34; a new set so I'm keeping it for my own. We both love using the screwdriver and wrench for around-the-house projects. Haven't really had a use for the socket wrench yet, but when I used it on the bikes that day, it made the job so much easier, and even fun! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:35:38	No Defect		Novice	No		false

28039120	This is a great tool, no question about it.  The motor is smooth as silk and it has good hand-feel for lack of a better word.  The only shortcoming, and it would only be useful in certain situations, is that it lacks a depth stop.  I have only seen this available on a Porter Cable unit as I recall and thought who needs that? but the more I use the tool the more I wish I had one and will likely fashion something in the future.  Don't be fooled by the depth gauge that is printed on some of the blades....no way in heck you can make out that gauge when the blade is shaking back and forth and sawdust is flying about. One additional comment....I was very wary of the unit when I first started using it based on the one review about an injured thumb and the blade release mechanism.  I can only speak for my particular Bosch unit, but there is no spring mechanism or preload in that lever at all.  Absolutely no way I could get injured on the unit I own. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:35:38	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
61029441	Have had no problems with the manufacturing or the usable versatility or the product. The Shaper arrived by a freight truck - no problems with that. However, the driver alerted us to the fact that the package was very damaged and was concerned about the contents inside. The box was hardly in its original shape at all. It was being held together by clear packing tape. Very disappointing. Customer service reps were very rude. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:35:38	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

This drill/driver replaced a 14v one that lasted over 8.5yrs; building a utility building and numerious other projects. I don't recommend this drill and will step up to a better quality product-CGCUPDATE -BD; replaced not only the battery but the entire drill motor with a 16v,LED installed light,LITHIUM item and is two thirds the size of the old one -Look for this one- 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:42:58	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
46389975	I have a 20gal compressor but turning that thing on just to inflate a tire or two is overkill.  What's worse is a couple of my tires loose 2-3 psi over the course of a week during the winter (even with remounting and new stems).  This inflator is exactly what you need.  Set it to desired pressure, turn it on, and walk away.  Gone are the days of measure, fill, measure, fill...  This item is a great time saver.  It is only about $25 over the cost of a brand name 120V air inflator--definitely worth it.  I actually love the fact that it has no power cord because those usually need another extension cord anyways.  It also comes with a nice wall mount.  Kudos Campbell Hausfeld!!! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:42:58	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
33670968	I made the 200 mile drive to the Springfield, MO showroom to pick up the jointer.  After reading about too many buyers with minor damage to the base from UPS shipments, I elected to go ahead, and make the 3-hour drive.  The base was well-packed, and was in ding-free condition.  Assembly was pretty straight forward.  Once that was completed, I began the cleanup.  Other reviews had mentioned everything being coated with cosmoline in super-heavy fashion.  With that in mind, I bought an aerosol can of Orange Power degreaser at Grizzly.  It wasn't necessary.  If you carefully scrape off the excess cosmoline with a putty knife, a small amount that remains can be cleaned off with some mineral spirits.I am somewhat disappointed in the flatness of the bed and fence.  The outfeed table had a dip in the center of about .05mm (.02) that was about 6 long.  The fence was twisted where the best I could do was to have a .05mm space at the top of the fence at the far end on the infeed table, and the same on the bottom of the outfeed table at the far end.  I never had either of these problems with my old 6 Delta open base jointer.  Of course, it was made here in the USA, Mississippi, I think, not China.I'm also disappointed in the smoothness, or lack of it, in moving the infeed table.  The Delta was pretty smooth.  The Grizzly takes some effort to get it to move using the handle.  When it does, it moves more than I wanted it to, and I have to work with it to get it to my liking.  Hopefully it will get better the more I use it.I checked the position of the knives, and they were set too high.  I used a dial gauge, and reset the knives to the same height as the bed.  From experience with the Delta, I learned to set the knives .02 low because they raise to zero out when you tighten things up.  The test edge joints were glass smooth.  I hope the blades hold up for awhile. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:42:58	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
59517870	The mop leaked all over the place. I went to Bissell's web site for help and was able to find some instructions about making sure that tubes were secure, etc. I was glad to find help, but I wish the mop wouldn't leak. Also, after you dry vac, you need to change the pad otherwise you are spreading dirt from the dry vac pad all over your floor. I wouldn;t recommend this product if you are looking for a mop. But if you just need a floor vac, this works well. It holds a charge for 10 or 15 minutes which allows me to vacuum the floors several times per week. ANd it has good suction. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:45:58	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

33672121	Works perfect. The one thing I would suggest would be to make it easy to remove the guide plate. Even though i love the angle set feature on it, it can prevent access to those hard to reach places.

53991355	Maybe its me. Maybe I didn't read the information correctly, but I had no idea that this stapler needed an air compressor. Which is not a big deal becuase my neighbor has one I can use, but the stapler didn't come with staples either so until I get a chance to get some I have no idea if it works well or not. It would have been nice if a small amount of staplers would have been included. Does it say anywhere that these are not included? 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:47:55	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
42996268	Every tool works well so far.  Name plate fell off the saw right away.  Rivet fell out and other side came loose from housing.  Saw works very well and so does the drill.  Light is Ok but doubt I'll find much use for it. The screw gun is a little odd to use but think I'll catch on to it.  Batteries seem to be taking charges well. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:47:55	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

25142847	One star is too good for this product. Yes, it might possibly cut straight, but I haven't even tried it since I will be returning it for 3 reasons: 1st, and 2nd: it is a #34;type 3#34; saw, which means it is no longer compatible with Dewalt's laser light, or led positioning light, 3rd: the clamp that should come as a standard part of the saw has a price tag of $50.Dewalt truly no longer wants customers! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:47:55	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
46667016	...if you know what you're getting, It's OK (aka Amazon's description of their 3-star ranking).If you've already got a stable of Ryobi 18V batteries, this saw has its shining moments -- particularly those times when there's some light-duty cutting to be done, and it's too much trouble to whip out the corded circular saw. So for quick, relatively clean cuts across a 2x4 (marginal frustration factor) or across a piece of scrap plywood (3/4 or less, moderate frustration factor) then this is OK.But be warned, mine bogs down on 3/4 ply so the cut proceeds at a snails pace. If you've got a not-off-the-charger-fresh yellow/black Ryobi NiCad battery, it'll probably deplete it in less then 12 inches. My fully charged LiIon will go the 4 foot distance, and still show green capacity level afterward, but the cutting process is agonizingly slow.So again, it's an OK saw for very small tasks on a limited wood stock, and even then it'll probably frustrate you as much as it frustrates me, but it still may be quicker than breaking out and plugging in the full-sized saw. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:47:55	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
28782024	I have used this nailer only a few times since It was delivered. It worked fine using Porter-Cable and SENCO brads that were on hand, with no jams or misfires. I am new to no-oil nailers , but like the concept and hope they last as long as a nailer that needs to be oiled!  I do wish the carry case had more storage space for brads!

60966507	This is a fantastic tool for a home owner or craft enthusiast.  The range of small tasks that you can achieve with the Multipro is unbelievable and easy, even for an untrained person.This kit includes a flexi-shaft, which helps you get into corners by extending the accessory bit using a long flexible shaft. You can buy the shaft separately if you already own the tool, but it's cheaper to get it with the kit if you're buying for the first time.  The carrying case is attractive, and fits everything with room to spare.Some of the things you can do with your Dremel tool include drilling holes to hang pictures, putting lot numbers on your house, engraving your initials on items you don't want stolen, sharpening scissors and lawn mower blades, cleaning jewellery or golf clubs, giving sticking doors and windows a quick repair, cleaning silverware or brass or even mag rims, installing your car stereo and adding auto accessories to dress your car, trimming nails that are sticking up, regrooving damaged screw heads, sanding in hard to reach places, and so on.It is however a small tool, so you shouldn't expect it to sand a dining table like a belt sander, or cut out a large wood pattern like a scroll saw.You need a tiny spanner to change accessories, but it's included in the kit, along with different mandrels to hold the bits securely.  There is a wide range of accessories available for even more tasks, and a great additional purchase is the tile cutting attachment, which allows you to do bathroom tile repairs with a lot less mess and guess work.The secret to the Dremel is the speed, with a range of varying speeds up to 35,000 rpm, which you control yourself.  The instruction booklet is very detailed, and gives you lots of tips.  Dremel also has an amazing website, with step by step how-to guides.Every home should have a Dremel Multipro 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:51:39	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
89742514	I am a young guy just married and settled into our first house so I needed some new power tools had some older ones that worked for the projects I had when renting an apt. in a city(not much area for building things) I have always like to build and fix things possibly why I became and engineer. I went back and forth between Milwaukee Tool and Dewalt and the more I looked and price as well as pros and cons from contractor friends and mechanic friends one of them said why do you need pro-grade tools yes they work great and last a long time but he said why dont I save some money and look at like black and decker they are lower cost and work fantasic for what I need. So for Christmas my father in law got us the 20v matrix (I say us because my wife and I build and do projects together she also enjoys it) I have used the Drill, Router, cutoff saw and Impact so far on a recent build and they all worked great) the battery has a good life to it ( I did buy a 2nd battery right away though may not have needed it after using it but nice to have) I would highly recommend this for any DIY person. surely I would not build a house with this even a big deck might be a bit too much for it that I would borrow something better from a friend. but its a great tool at a great price. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 11:51:39	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

41264644	I'm sure that the chuck listed is a quality device. What I received after ordering it, however, is another chuck entirely: A generic import chuck with 0.003#34; runout (eccentricity) which looks quite different than the picture. The runout is so severe that after initial installation, I broke a centering bit and ruined my workpiece. That's when I measured the eccentricity. The JT adapter to which it was mounted had essentially zero runout, and I took the time to carefully clean the tapers and remount the chuck. The best I could achieve was 0.0025#34; runout, which is 5-10 times what I'd consider acceptable.I returned it in exchange for an American-made chuck. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 12:02:07	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

My experience of June, 2012 has been:  fast shipping, arrived with return label, should it be needed , in excellent condition, with 1000 1 staples included. Stapler work beautifully.

59175136	Getting the three bases is great.  One for the router table, and then having the plunge and d-handle for hand work is great.Soft-start makes it easier to control when starting, no more jerking when starting.  Variable speed controller another nice feature when working with easily burned woods.This was the perfect replacement for my DW610.  As with most tools, its only as good as the cutting bit/blade/knife.  Stay away from the cheapo HSS bits.  I stick with carbide tipped, anti-kickback bit with 1/2 shank whenever possible and have always had excellent results. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 12:05:55	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

46457914	I bought this tool because the old hand me down craftsman wouldn't stay locked. It also had the old set screw holding the blade in. The quick change feature of this jigsaw is worth it alone. When I was redoing my house I needed a little help so I called up my carpenter to come help me with a few things. He saw the saw sitting on the saw horse and tested it out. He started cutting a tight circle in a piece of scrap 2x6 pressure treated wood. When he was done he said That's a nice jigsaw, too bad it's a DeWalt. He has a professed dislike for DeWalt (doesn't have single tool by them), but even he was impressed. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 12:05:55	No Defect		Expert	No		false
39816974	I have used several nailers including Hitachi.  THis worked as well as any I have used.  It is light weight and had two slight jams that were easy to clear out of the 15,000 nails it ate in its first three days of use.  The two jams may have been (probably) from a bend in the nail coil and not the fault of the gun.  Loading is super fast.  I would highly reccomend. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 12:05:55	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

47068265	1.  My most used cordless tool.  I have a huge Ryobi 18V 3 speed hammer drill, thought I did not need this much smaller and lighter impact driver.  Was I ever wrong!  This is far better for driving screws than a drill motor, much faster on smaller screws, can drive up to 4 screws into naughty pine, though it slows down to a crawl.  Better for drilling small holes too, with the bits that have the hex driver end.2.  Far better and safer on the top of a tall ladder, as average torque is low, will not threaten to throw you off ladder or twist out of the hand like the big drill motor will do.  The impact action makes it easier to hold the Phillips bit to the screw.3. Ryobi did the right thing and introduced the 18V LiIon battery that was generally backwards compatible with the 18V nickel metal hydride, what other company supported their customers so?4. What do these cost as of June 2010, 60$?  Buy 4 of these for the price of the Makita.5. Longevity compared to Makita?  Unknown to me.  3 years of every weekend use, 2 day a week usage, and the brushes are just now starting to fail.6. 2013-07: I thought that the brushes were beginning to fail, because a few times the motor did not start upon trigger pull, had to wack it, but this just keeps going and going.  Built a balcony, deck, fences, over-loading it with 4 screws, and it just keeps going strong.  Nice. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 12:08:35	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

39783909	This review would be beneficial for customers outside the US as well.I live in Israel and we work with 220V and 50 Hz.This machine has done a long way before arrived here in excellent shape which brings me to the first point of how well and secure it was packed. The box went from Grizzly warehouses to another warehouse in NJ where it was picked up and sent to Israel by freight. Here it had to do two more journeys from the port to the shipping company's warehouse and from there to me. I was very concerned about how it will survive the trip and I have to say it was the best it could get.Unpacking and assembly took a few hours and if you are a hobbyist like me, these are several hours of fun !The instructions are perfectly clear, proper English not like some manuals of products made in the east.There was hardly any tune up to be done. I just had to tune the outgoing bed height, took a few seconds.I operate the Jointer with a 220to110 3000W transformer and it works great !The machine is heavy hence the lack of vibrations which lets you perform very precise work.The noise level when idling is very acceptable (nothing like the brush type motors).Setting the fence in right angle to the bed is easy and once set it stays set, simple as that.Until now I was using a 10 thicknesser and I never experienced two pieces of wood joining so accurately as I did with this Grizzly. It is just spot on. I made a butcher block made of a mix of Pine, Mahogany, Oak and Teak 6 wide, it didn't even sound like it was laboring and came out smooth as anything. Creating the right angle on the edges, same thing, perfect!Finally, the quality of the parts and the paint work, to put it in one sentence, if I was not told it was manufactured in China, I wouldn't guess !Before I bought this machine I had to make a choice between a 10 planner-thicknesser not cast iron and this one. I figured out that in most of the cases I did not plane boards wider than 6 so a thought that a 6 massive jointer backed up with a thicknesser would be a better choice, and I do not regret it.About the final price, if anyone here (Israel) wonders if it was worth it after shipping and customs, the answer is yes very much so !! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 12:38:40	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

55036078	The LED lights are essentially useless, just a gimmick. The spark and eye shields just get in the way of doing anything, you would be much better off with a pair of goggles or safety glasses. Unit seems fairly powerful but it will slow somewhat with heavy pressure. Would be nice if it came with one stone and one wire brush instead of two stones but that would probably add a little to the cost. It seems to be well balanced and runs smoothly, very little vibration or tendency to #34;walk#34; and I do not even have it secured to the bench. Remains to be seen how long it will last but for now I say, for the price, you could do a lot worse. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 12:49:59	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

36106483	I've been using this little router for some 20 years now and it is my go-tool for any most of my routing tasks.  I have half a dozen routers in the shop, including some very expensive and precision units, but this little guy is so handy that unless I need super stability or precision micro-adjustments, I grab this one.  It has done miles of laminate and counter-edge trimming of oak and other hardwoods, and after probably hundreds of hours of use it is still running as new.Is it perfect?  No.  The height adjustment is at best, primitive.  I've just learned how to set its depth-of-cut with minimum follow-up corrections.  The nut that is supposed to secure the base to the body needs to be tightened with pliers, since hand tightening is just not enough to prevent it from loosening and then moving during a cut.  My trimmer came with the full laminate-trimming kit in a nice steel carrying case, and back when laminate counter tops were still acceptable in kitchens, this kit was great.I routinely abuse this little machine by doing long 12#8221; radius roundovers on long beams and such, and it has never overheated or shown any signs of stress. I like the fact that it has a shaft-lock so that only one wrench is required to change bits.  The button is not very well placed, however, and I seem to hit it occasionally during use.  No damage has resulted, but it makes a lot of noise and is no doubt not good for the tool.  Also, the power switch is not placed well, as it is a two-handed operation to shut the machine off.Bottom line:  After more than 20 years of use, I'd replace this tool with another just like it. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 12:51:00	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
29077161	The product name speaks for itself...Compact, rapid charging and very useful for jobs you never even thought of before.I am totally loving this set of Makitas.

56582848	I'm not a professional, I'm just a homeowner who appreciates quality tools, but it seems they got all the details right on this saw.  Miter and bevel were perfectly aligned out of the box, which I checked with my triangle and with some test cuts.  Getting it out of the box was easy too, thanks to the carrying handle on the saw head which is very solid and close to the center of balance.  (Usually with big items like this you have to figure out how to get your hands underneath it and then hold the box down while you get it out.)  The locking pin which keeps the saw head down when you're carrying it can be slid in and out easily but has no problem supporting the weight, while the spring that raises the head prevents the pin from sliding out accidentally.  There are also good hand holds on each side of the base with rounded edges so they don't dig into your hands.Bevel stops at 0 and 45 degrees make it easy to switch between common angles, but can be slid back after loosening a screw to allow a few more degrees either way when you need to compensate for other cuts that were a little off (made by someone else, of course).  There's also a flip-out stop for 33.9 degree bevel which is also solidly made.  The bevel locking knob-thing is nice and big, making it easy to grip and turn.  The adjustable fence can be quickly adjusted with a single knob, but is still very sturdy when tightened down.Miter adjustment is rock solid.  The quick detents have no wiggle room at all, and the detent override makes it easy to adjust to any angle.  The simple push-down miter lock is easy to use, and once locked I was unable to force it slip to either side.The dust bag collects a bit over half of the sawdust, and as a result fills up pretty quickly.  I'm planning to get an adapter so I can connect my shopvac to the dust outlet.  If you're wondering, the dust port is 1.5 O.D.Everything about this saw is sturdy, and all the adjustments can be made with very little effort.  It's also a little quieter than I expected, which is nice.  You can't go wrong with this saw. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:01:36	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
36673632	This is my third Grizzly product, and first planer. I have used my brother in laws larger planer in the past, but didn't feel like driving 80 miles one way every time I needed wood planed. So I bought the GO505, and it is pretty basic, no frills, it works well enough, but I wish I had spent more and gotten a larger model. I feel the feed rate is to fast on the GO505, on a wide board, it only takes a half a turn on the crank to make it grunt, wide boards tend to make it labor if the depth is turned more then a half a turn per cut. I just wish I had spent a little more on a bigger model. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:01:36	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
27059162	This ash vac is good as far as not sending dust everywhere.  The ash does however clog the hose, which is a pain.  You have to take it outside and knock the ash loose.  This could be because we have an insert and the ash is so fine.  I gave it a three because it could just be my ash is so fine, not because the vacuum itself.  I do however look at it as a waste of money.  It is easier just to shovel the ash and our craftsman to clean up. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:04:22	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

54935656	This is a really nice drill.  It has good balance,  is not too heavy,  and is the correct size to get into small,  awkward spaces.

60617118	The grinder I just bought still has the two holed spanner nut, but the web description says that it should be a hex nut.  The box does not contain a spanner wrench with a 1-3/8 spacing and I have no way to tighten or loosen the stupid nut.  The tool itself looks good, but if I can't use it I have to give it a single star, at least until I find a wrench that fits.Update:  The spanner nut has two hex holes in it that you can put the included allen wrench into.  Now, I have to give the grinder a 4 star - I'd give it 5 stars except that the written instructions could be A LOT clearer on this subject. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:04:22	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
41104862	I received my new jointer-planer in great condition and put together right away. As of previous reviewers I will also say that this machine does not have the best assembly instructions which is not a big deal , especially if you have a minimum technical knowledge. After putting everything together I planed a 2x4 on each side and I was impressed with the results! I got very smooth surface and square corners. I can't see any wavy surface at all, considering the only 2 knives this tool has. For me, this tool is a great value for the money ($350) for any small, beginner to intermediate woodworking. There is few video reviews on you tube that are showing worpt fence etc - don't pay attention to them, the machine is well made, does the work very good and will save you a tone of money and work space. $350 are well spend in this case. They are a much nicer products on a market of course , but for a much higher price also. I don't think that spending several houndred more $ will be smart choice if you going to get almost unnoticeable better cut from a more expensive machine. All my major tools I have in my work shop are not even close to the expensive stuff and I am able to make products with very high quality. Buying expensive tools is not always guarantee for better done job. That depends on the person behind the tool also.There is one thing about this tool I don't really like and that is the dust chute needed to be moved back and fourth when switching between planer-jointer mode. There is a safety button located under the surface of the in feed table ,which is being pressed down by the dust chute and closing the circuit in order to the running of the machine. The safety button looks very easy to be shimmed and hold permanently down which will take care of this problem.Overall - one nice , comfortable, space-saving , convenient little tool for a great price! I will recommend it to everyone! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:08:58	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

45003938	So easy to use.  Very safe.  The Light is fabulous.  The balance is just right for me.  I use this everywhere.  I can't overstate how easy it is to position a board and have it end up nailed exactly where I want it.  For an amateur like me it makes a huge difference.

25333947	Yup, another high quality/high priced tool accessory from Festool.  If you do much edge routering with a Festool router, you need this to make the router more stable when it is hanging over the edge of the workpiece.  You could make your own, but this one is perfectly flat, smooth, and helps with dust collection.  Fits OF 1400 EQ. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:13:18	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

26219980	This drill is a heavy duty model designed for applications that are too tough for battery operated models and most other corded drills.  I have used mine for drilling into railroad ties, landscape timbers and support posts while building retaining walls, decks and patios.  I have also used it for auguring 3x12 holes for planting bulbs in my flower beds.  It has never once overheated or failed to perform, and the price offered by this vendor made it an outstanding value. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:13:18	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
29492383	I love DeWalt tools they seem to be always over the top on design, versatility and ease of use. I had bought this drill with batteries and charger several months back and really had not a chance to use until yesterday. I pulled out drill and charger and grabbed a battery to charge, put in charger and left for about 4 hours, came back still no charge, swapped batteries out and had the other batterycharged within 45 minutes. I went and finished my project, came back to charge the other battery, still dead the next day and even into late evening. I would have given a 5 star but I want what I pay for. Very disappointed. Will probably never buy tools online again. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:13:18	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
34496499	This exceeded my expectations by a longshot!  It has plenty of torque for most projects.  I keep one at work and it gets used as much or more than the one at home.  People are always asking to borrow it.  My wife likes it due to its more manageable size. If speed is not an issue, this will fit almost all of your cordless drill needs. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:21:21	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
35610487	Received the 16 gauge angled finish nailer as a gift recently.  Worked at first, then began to misfire with increasing frequency.  Recharged batteries and new fuel cells don't help.  Will have to take it to the service center soon, but from the other reviews I've read, I am not holding out much hope of a fix.I don't know the circumstances of folks who claim that their guns work, but Paslode is obviously seling a significant number of guns that don't work.  It beats me why anyone would want to roll the dice on this device when a reliable alternative (i.e., pneumatic nail gun) is available.  With such a high number of defective guns sold already, has there been a product liability class action of any sort initiated yet?

22451381	The rip fence is absolutely useless, your only chance to get a good cut is to use a square and manually hold the square or clamp it down while you push the tile throughthe motor mount is not a clean 90 degree angle as well, the weight of the motor bends the frame and the tile blade is not perpendicular to what it is cutting and bogs down because of too much friction and a lack of motor powerI was so frustrated with this saw that the same day I drove to Lowes and bought a real tile saw for $300+The only reason I am giving the tile saw more than 1 star is because it is a fair price for what you get, for the small tile saws under $150 it is typical, my advice is to avoid all these low end saws where you have to use your hand to push the tile and get a tile saw with a tray or a moving bridge, if you must get a cheap tile saw get one where the blade is under mount like a table saw 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:21:21	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
52829260	We bought this as an upgrade from the 1590EVS, which we have a couple of and use everyday for cabinet install work.  Wish we hadn't.  Have had  problems with the base plate not staying locked in position.  Sent it in to Bosch for warranty repair.  They say it is fine.  Issue persists.Also, not sure why they switch to the plastic baseplate with the metal cover.  Older versions had metal plate with plastic cover which seemed to make a lot more sense.  New base plate also has less support around blade, making it hard to cut narrow pieces.  Have had problems with baseplate gouging material while cutting.Either we got a bad one or Bosch just really missed the mark on the redesign here.  Usually they make great tools.  We continue to use the older 1590's while this one sits in it's case. Would have returned it but we missed Amazon's return window. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:21:21	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
54201824	I bought this saw less than two years ago.  I don't use this machine that often, so there aren't very many hours of time on it.  I used it today, and the tracking adjuster which is a cast metal part snapped in two, making the saw on usable. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:40:02	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
59551232	Bought this for my farmer/trucker husband who has no tools actually at the house because they're all on the truck or at the farm!  Comes in super handy for all the curtains  pictures we've hung as well as putting together furniture, fixing bathroom fans, etc.  Came with extra battery pack  carrying case: AWESOME!

38764140	This is still working 2 years later but It's under powered. There are some packages The plastic is too thick and this will lock up. It will zip through single sheets of paper but I got it for those darn plastic packages that tear up your hands trying to open.

23969492	This is a very sturdy vacuum. Rather like you would expect a wet/dry vac to be built,although it admittedly comes at a fairly steep price. Overall, if it lasts 10 years or more (which I would expect), it will be a good buy in the long run. It's a smidge quieter than the cheaper (Home Depot/Lowes) models, but again MUCH better build quality. The hose that comes standard is the only flimsy part that I notice. It's pretty thin and tends to kink quite easily. The BIG oddity with this vac is that it comes with NO attachments. They will run you over $100 for a kit or all sorts of normally standard items. THAT sucks :) and is why I knocked it for a star. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:40:02	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
45372060	I am on my 3rd one now. I love the things. I use them for work removing and putting tv backs and parts on and off. If you need to screw screws in to wood this is not the driver for you.

39321160	just one week after I received my drill, I saw it for 1/2 of what I paid at Home Depot.It's a fine product, but a disappointing price (I am suprised that Amazon does not offer any price protection)- as always, the service was good, the delivery was on time etc., but it was not the value I had hoped for. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:43:39	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

38992413	This router is excellent. The fixed base is not as tall as other models and this makes it easier to stabilize when doing edge profiles. The plunge base has a very smooth action and the depth gauge is accurate and easy to use. The motor is strong and has not bogged down on me yet.

23705767	I bought this primarily to do the dog's nails after wearing out an old corded model.  It worked beautifully for awhile, but within a few weeks the battery would not hold a charge.  The company's customer service was fabulous.  Within a week of returning the battery, I had received a new one.  Unfortunately, I am having exactly the same problem after less than a year.  I can't even get a single toe nail done before the device is out of juice.  The second battery is going back this week.  I expect that the good folks at Dremel will take care of this.Even though the cordless is handy, I wish I'd paid the extra money for the more reliable corded model. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:46:30	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

The best tool, prior to this hammer and clay spade, was a claw hammer. I did in 4 hours more than I had done in a month with manual tools. Great investment. I would not that now and then the piston does get stuck in the outword possition but you just need to bump it back and away you go.

39110225	After burning up several small diameter masonry bits (5/32#34;) using a yellow and black hammer drill and getting nowhere with the job, I saw this drill on Amazon and at the price I figured I might as well chance buying it.  The price was slightly higher than what it would cost to rent a SDS drill but I figured after the cost of driving to and from the rental store, it would be a wash.  The drill arrived when Amazon predicted it would.  I was able to drill four holes into a poured concrete floor faster than I did with the hammer drill.I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:48:08	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

53133952	Just purchased the Delta 14-651 mortiser from Amazon.  Shipping was exceptionally quick, however the packing material was in bad shape when I opened the box.  Once degreased and assembled I found that the head would not travel smoothly along the column - it would jamb in some areas and move easily in others.  After some investigation I found out that the rack (the long straight gear on the column) was very poorly machined.  After about an hour and a half of work with a mill file I was able to even out the teeth and widen/deepen the notches on the rack.  The mortiser now moves smoothly on the column.I'm happy with the mortiser now that the movement has been fixed, but beware of poor quality in the rack and gear system. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:48:08	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
46736834	I have not used it extensively yet, but am happy with results so far. The case is nice because it keeps it all contained but the metal is a very light gauge and it may not last very long. It is also leaking oil after two uses, but it is working great, I just need to keep an eye on the oil(I could probably change a gasket for a fix). 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:48:08	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
51211064	This is a fantastic tool, I have had it over a year but only use it occasionally. It's usefulness amazes me every time I use it. I have only cut wood with it, using the included blade, I would imagine it would be a shocking difference to use a better built blade on the saw. But it still cuts fairly easily through any wood I have used it on so far. It was $25 well spent. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 13:53:13	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

48021593	Ironically, one of the most useful items in our house was the little powerhouse stored in the garage, the wet/dry shop vac. It has seen us through many a project and/or emergency, not to mention car maintenance. Upon its recent demise, the old vac has been replaced by the Workshop Wet/Dry Vac WS1600VA. With more horsepower and more options than our trusty old vac, this one is sure to be a staple for years to come, featuring the usual options, large liquid capacity, easy filter change, large drain for liquid disposal, car nozzle and extension wands, this new shop vac is a welcome member of the family.

These Lithum-ion batteries are head and shoulders above the other type batteries. They are stronger, last longer and charge faster... what more could you ask for! I gave all my older cordless Makitas away to my friends when these came out. It would be nice if Makita could have come out with a retro-fit Lithium-ion battery for the older cordless tools out there.

61195518	I purchased the Bosch tool set in late December. I am a contractor who needs durable and reliable tools. When I started my search, I researched the Porter Cable, Milwaukee and Dewalt cordless sets. I have all three brands in corded/pneumatic tools and have been satisfied with their performance. I limited my search to these brands until I saw the Bosch.Hands down, the build of Bosch was superior to the other three. And their attention to little things makes me very glad I made the purchase. For example:1. The drill with its hook is invaluable, especially when hanging sheetrock. It is heavier than the others, but sturdier in the hand.2. The reciprocating saw has an adjustable foot and varying blade stroke. Both features are used often by me. My job has me cutting pipe, 2 by's, sheetrock, etc. and these features have made the job easier.3. The circular saw comes with and exhaust port to attach to my portable vac. I can cut inside now with limited dust. Additionally the depth gage is handy4. The jig saw with the blow port helps keep the line open to the eye and the ability to change the orbital action is great when stepping up the cut. (the saw works the best with bosch t-blades)5. Ok - the light is the worst - Dewalts is much better.The kicker in making the decision to purchase the Bosch was the 3 year warranty. I have had to use it once already. The head on the recip saw broke. I was sent a new one in a few days and was up and running. I get the feeling that the head has been an issue. The new one I received was made different.The bag is a bit of a pain, but it does allow me to carry the charger, and three cases containing recip saw blades, jigsaw blades and drill bits.For the money, the Bosch Cordless set is a very good choice. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:04:14	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
24133763	It is a good drill, but unfortunately the description was in error, not the drill described. I had to send it back since it is not what I expected. The company (CPO) had since corrected the description, but I am out of the return charge through no fault of my own. I hink in a case like this (erroneous advertising) my expenses should be reimbursed in full. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:04:14	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
22809770	after reading other reviews, I decided to buy this tool to lay oak flooring (400 sq ft) instead of renting a tool (I have done this in the past).  I oiled the tool well before starting and the nails were a fraction of an inch off from the nail bed with the wood I got from holme thepot.  So I removed the white spacer on the bottom and added a couple of pieces of paper to shim it.  Then it worked great!  I wish I had bought it for my last job.The tool comes with a hammer (although not in the pictures), spare o-rings, and some tools to disassemble the tool if needed. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:09:55	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

60117895	This sander is heavy, durable and rigid.. If it only worked! The belt stopped turning after 10 minutes of use on the first one I bought. I called customer support, they sent me a return label and a replacement unit. Great customer service. I received a second unit which broke in less than 2 minutes.. And these things are not exactly fun to carry back and forth to the UPS store. It's a 50 lbs machine!

31291587	Bought this sander 1 year ago to back up my Porter-Cable 352vs (I have since grown so tired of repairing the Porter-Cable that the last time it needed repair I just threw it away).  It runs so quietly for a belt sander that the first time I used it I thought the speed control was set on low (it was on high). It's well balanced, has plenty of power, and the dust bag actually collects a lot of dust, a huge plus when I have to scribe cabinets inside a customers house.  Also, the shape of the sander makes it easy to clamp to a workbench for sanding small items, an impossibility with the Porter-Cable. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:09:55	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

I mean when you have to make stuffing for a family of 20 or a tripple batch of ginger bread nothing compares to the durability of this product.  Yes; you heard me right ,this is a great product to use in the kitchen.  Where other tools fail this one comes threw in spades.

15117361	I already have the previous model Dremel 4000 and use it for all manner of small tasks so I was excited to try the latest 4200.This is a corded rotary tool approximately the same size as the 4000 and similar in looks, weight and how it feels in your hands. The biggest difference aesthetically is that the Dremel 42000 has a much thicker cord with an extra sleeve at the base of the handle to further protect it where it flexes the most. The most obvious functional difference is the new EZ Change Chuck and EZ Change lever you can use to open and close the chuck. The one other new addition is the electronic feedback.If you used to the old chuck and collets you will love the Dremel 4200. It doesn't need any collets to use regular Dremel attachments like you the  previous Dremel tools did. You just pull the EZ Lock levers back, slide in your tool and push the levers back and you're done. It's that simple though the levers are quite stiff and might be tough for children. For me this was a vast improvement. It seems to grip well. The only attachment I couldn't use was the small chuck that I sometimes use for drill attachments. Unfortunately the EZ Chuck can't grip a variety of drill bits.  Otherwise it would be near perfect. You still need to purchase collets to hold varying thickness and the collets from old dremel tools are not compatible.I was a little concerned about the flex shaft not being compatible with the new EZ Change system. Fortunately the kit comes with an adaptor included so there's no need to worry. Same with the Drill stand. It comes with the old collar for attaching to the stand and since it's the same shape as the old one, it hooks right up.I wasn't really sure what the electronic feedback was. But I noticed much that the Dremel 42000 was much smoother. When you start up and grind, cut or drill the tool starts up very smoothly and seems to compensate for any sudden jarring action when it hooks on something. So it feels like there is more torque and less jarring.If you have a recent dremel tool already that you use infrequently it probably isn't worth upgrading till the old one has broken. However, if you use it frequently and make use of many different attachments then this is a must have. Changing attachments is so much simpler and quicker. No extra collets required for attachments.  You just pull the lever, remove, insert attachment, push lever and you're off. I tried all the usual attachments I have without a problem.This is easily the best Dremel rotary tool to date. If only it could handle a wider range of thicknesses such as drill bits without having to purchase additional collets it would be perfect. I will have to use my old Dremel tool for drill bits. Hopefully they will come out with a chuck at a later date.  If they make this one modification it will be perfect. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:14:23	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

29430670	First things first: If you're a pro, or a serious woodworker looking for a tool to use every day- or even every week- this ain't the one. It doesn't have the muscle to drive 50 screws deep into wood, or to drill steel, or any of a dozen other things you might want a good cordless drill motor for.But that's not what I bought it for. I've got a good Makita 1/2 cordless, and a couple of corded drills for that. This was for my girlfriend, who needs a drill once in a blue moon, and would like an electric screw driver for regular tasks around the house. And for that kind of use, it's very good indeed.So if you're looking for a convenient drill for light duty use, the BD; 9.6v is not a bad choice. One hint: The wall wart charger takes a long time to bring the drill up to full charge, so if you're thinking of regular use, get the fast charger and a second battery. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:18:23	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

54314879	I am completely satisfied with this product, so far. The fitted plastic clam shell case is sturdy and comes well organized with sub-groups of tools encased within it.  I've found the tools to be of very good quality, marketed with a Lifetime Replacement Guarantee from Tekton.  The wide selection of tool types and sizes (for SAE, Metric, and even proprietary applications) included in this particular set should be adequate for repairing the majority of mass-produced consumer electronic devices and notebook computers (whether a PC or a Mac).  Fairly priced at ~$30.  Zero regrets! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:26:37	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

33623235	To save reading/typing, I'll echo what M/M Larsen, Martin, and Takahashi all said. I bought mine for the exact reason of M. Larsen....Additionally, I was in the water intrusion forensics in the mid-90s and saw someone use it on stucco to line out where to break out the stucco. They had multiple batteries and back then, the saw was a wonder.People have to remember that in the early-mid-90s, 9.6v was state of the art. The saw seems so under powered now, but back then, it was one of the first of its kind. Makita does make a 14.4v unit.Longevity: I used mine on site over several years and 40 water intrusion forensic jobs...inside and outside (mostly for drywall, though), and I have the original one I bought in 1996. I bought a little tool box for it and have been soooooo happy.I retro-fitted the masonry water-drip kit and have cut tile, flagstone, brick, maybe thin concrete, and most recently....a granite countertop--all counter to opinion I heard today from a Home Depot whiz. Where other saws don't fit, this one does (heads in, not the long tail-end) with much less chance of overcutting--kind of important on one-time-get-it-right cuts.It isn't good for plunge cutting (not a surprise---other saws are designed for that), and the batteries don't last long if you're doing heavy cutting. But for small, fine cuts...Foot stomp: like the others said... get a carbide blade. Oh, charge the battery before using it out of the box. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:28:51	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
59168883	I have owned the Makita for about 3 years.  I needed a router with more HP and variable speed to compliment my PC 690 kit.  I chose the Makita over the Bosch because I could use my PC accessories with it.  I have not been disappointed.  It has been a reliable performer.  I am a hobbyist and have used it on many projects thus far, including a full set of kitchen cabinets with 31 doors.  It is super smooth and very quiet.  You can easily hear the bit cutting the wood over the sound of the motor.  Even my wife commented on the diminished decibels - she claims the noise from the PC sent shivers up her spine above all other tools including my portable planer!I have received years of dependable service from my PC.  That said, the workmanship of the Makita excels over the PC.  Small things stand out vs. the PC such as the machining of the collets, quality of collet wrenches and powercord, etc.  And as another reviewer stated, its just much nicer to use.  I always reach for it first. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:28:52	No Defect		Expert	No		false

56496763	Grab a simple pair of earplugs, this tool and your air compressor and you will wonder why you ever used a hammer! This drives nails in with such ease and with no bent nails! I had a 1 1/2 year old sleeping in the next room and he was still asleep when we got finished. We are using it to nail furring strips onto the ceiling with 8penny nails. I was not looking forward to driving a hammer over my head- but this little tool is lightweight to pass between my husband and I during the job and efficient enough that we finished off a whole box of nails in just a few minutes!

24609476	I purchased this nailer strictly because of its low price. I am a casual user doing some remodeling and did not want to spend 2 to 3 times as much for a unit that is probably of higher quality. I have been using it for a couple of months now while doing some finish woodwork and think I made a wise choice.As is mentioned in the other reviews and seems to be true with most of the tools made in asia, the instruction sheets are terrible. I was able to figure out the PSI requirement and the available adjustment for various size pins OK.The unit is well constructed and so far only two things I noticed have been an issue. First, the trigger safety lock is flimsy and swings around with gravity and sometimes gets in the way of firing it. I have not looked to see if I can fix it or not. Second, and of more concern is the operation of the slider that operates the pin magazine. You open it, set the pins in the magazine and then slide the magazine cover over the pins and it locks in place. This unit has a tolerance problem (IMHO) and the slider is VERY tight over the pins and it has to be forced into place. I am assuming that there should be about 3 to 10 thousandths clearance between the top of the pins and the slider. You can force it over the pins and it works just fine but that just can't be correct. Note: By force, I mean I have to push it quite hard to slide it over the pins. I have tried several sizes of pins and they all work the same. I am using Bostich pins so maybe they are longer than the manufacturer expected them to be. They did not recommend any brand or specify the length of the pins.Anyway, I think it is a very good unit for the price and would certainly recommend it for the weekend woodworker. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:33:24	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false

46726680	Ryobi ZRP824 ONE Plus 18V Cordless Starter Combo Kit Plus is WAY TOO-HEAVY to handle with ease. The repairman I've hired has a lighter/easy-to-handle Ryobi ONE Plus 18V, so I purchased this set thinking I would be getting the same.I HAVE NOT RETURNED this item or made an issue, not wishing to agonize the seller - his/her asking price is lower than others  just venturing out on Amazon Market Place - for it's not the seller's fault.The irony is the circular saw is smaller which should be larger  the screw driver which should be smaller/lighter is huge/unwieldy - the reverse. Discouraged  disenchanted, I've lightly used only the screw driver as of now.Foresee Only-Limited-Use.

32739540	An absolutly great machine. Quiet vibration free and a fantastic quill travel. It's like driving a Rolls Royce. It goes through any stock effortlessly with any kind of bit.I can't say enough about this drill press. It is perfect for thehomeowner/contractor workshop. All componants are quality, heavy grade and machined or casted perfect.  The external depth stop is a joy to use and the value can't be matched. I was considering the Jet, but I am glad I opted for the Delta.I put mine on an HTC 2000 mobil base and mounted it on two pieces of 3/4 inch ply glued and screwed togeater and then sat it in the roll around base.  I made the base 22 x 30 for added stablity. The end result is a heavy weight machine with all the bells and whistles that I can move around with one hand.

1107849	This is a pretty good product to have handy in a drawer for little quick jobs that don't justify getting out the trusty (but large) 18volt driller/driver.  It's a good size, easy to learn to use and designed fairly well.  This is prefect for installing a few long winded bolts like the kind you#8217;d find on a vacuum cleaner body, washmachine, ect.  Also this works fine for drywall screws, removing cabinet screw and such.  The motor is NOT powerful enough sinking wood screws or anything of that nature.Pros:Good sizeEasy to useWell designedThe only 3 things I don't really like about it (and these are minor complaints):1- It's kind of weak, don't expect to sink a 2#34; wood screw with this.  I'm sure it's not designed for this but it is a little weaker than I expected.2- The battery life isn't that great.  I would have expected a lot longer life from a single charge than it seems to get but I just keep the charger handy on my work station.3- It#8217;s pretty much impossible to #8220;start#8221; the driver in #8220;neutral#8221;.  By this I mean, once you push the palm button the bit will start turning (forward or reverse) regardless of how straight you try to hold the driver, I would like it better if the bit didn#8217;t move at all until you intentionally started twisting your wrist.  Again, though, these are small things, for the price it#8217;s a good product to have handy in a drawer. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:39:55	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

41604200	I have My Saw for for a little more then Two years and it is Great. I have a had no problems with anything, I would only tell those looking into the saw think of the extras that you might want it is cheaper to buy the saw with them Vs. adding them later such as the fence and the Wings they are just fine the way they are being stamped steal but I wanted to upgrade them to the cast iron but cant seem to find them and as for it being like a Jeep It is a work house it looks for little or no mataince looks might not be all that but it does a great job other things to keep in mind the cast iron weights down the saw which will reduce the vibration and you might want to change the belt with a inter locking V belt it does a great job on reducing vibration as well.

28906822	As an avid hiker and an... avid apartment dweller, my car has a way of accumulating dirt, as well as being inconveniently parked for vacuum access.  Prior to this purchase, my options were to drag my old Hoover and a hundred feet of extension cord out my front door to my car, or drive to a gas station and feed quarters in a machine every week as I frantically suck up all the old mud and pine needles before it shuts off.  Neither of these were ideal, so I bought something that would work.  This handheld vacuum is exactly what I need, as it provides the right amount of suction and plugs into my car outlet.  The power is not industrial-strength, but it's much more than expected for something not that much bigger than a flashlight.  The included accessories are also very useful, as is the ability to suck up a spilled drink or pooled rain water that came in the crack when a friend neglected to roll the window all the way up.  When I bring a weekend's worth of dirt and debris back into my car, this vacuum picks it up without issue.  It makes my worries of Sunday-night cleaning go away, which is good, because I don't like to clean on Sunday night, a.k.a. Netflix night. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:44:22	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

46127632	This compressor is fairly small and light, it measures 11 by 5 by 8.5 inches and weighs probably under 2 pounds. According to the manual, it draws 3 Amps at 120 Volts, which makes it at least 3-5 times more powerful than a portable compressor powered from auxiliary socket (those are typically limited to lt;10 Amps at 12 V). Performance-wise, it seems to be beating cheap $20-range compressors by a factor of 5 to 10. It takes about 30 seconds to pump a sizeable SUV tire (e.g., 235-65-R17) from 28 psi to 32 psi. At this speed, adding air to the tires is a fast and easy process.This great performance does not come as a surprise. Generally, 12 V sockets in cars are protected with 10 Amps fuses, which limits the power which compressors can draw to 120 Watts maximum. The best portable compressors run at 20-30 Amps but they have to be connected directly to the car's battery, which is a somewhat messy and sometimes dirty process. With at least three times greater power (360 Watts) and larger air pump size one can expect much faster performance from this compressor - and it does deliver.It creates a fair amount of noise, in my judgment close to the noise level of a typical vacuum cleaner. Since pumping time is usually short (unless the tire is completely empty), noise is not an issue, and in any case it is quite tolerable.The round bright display is a nice feature, but unfortunately it is quite inaccurate. My compressor shows approximately 4 psi lower pressure than a portable digital gauge and TPMS display in the car. Hence, I have to set  in to 35-36 psi in order to get actual pressure to 32 psi. It is frustrating to see such inaccuracy in a fairly expensive compressor - they probably could've made it accurate by spending extra thirty cents on the parts but they did not. This is the only reason why I ranked it four stars. You have to have either a separate tire pressure gauge or TPMS with pressure indicator in the car just to calibrate the compressor, or you need to get it freshly pumped to a target pressure by a tire shop or using a more accurate compressor. Then you can plug this one in and it will show you what reading this correct pressure corresponds to on its scale.The compressor comes with one year warranty, which is nice as it suggests some level of quality. It does not come with a power cord, but I do not see it as an issue because one has to use an extension cord anyway to be able to reach every tire on the car, and extension cord can be plugged directly into the compressor. The good part is that it comes with a wall hanger and screws to hang it in the garage.Since it is automatic - you dial in the desired pressure (with the correction for the gauge error) and push the start button - it is very easy to operate, and there is no need to watch the pressure as it runs. When the target pressure is reached, it shuts off by itself. To pump the next tire, you disconnect the air hose from the valve stem, connect to the next tire, and press the red button again. Very easy.I used in only on 8 tires so far and can't judge the build quality and reliability, but so far the impression has been very positive. Compared to my portable emergency compressor, this one is nicer, quieter, and SO MUCH FASTER! Of course, this speed comes at a price of portability - you need 120 V to plug it in, and obviously it requires too much power to be compatible with a basic 100 - 175 W car inverters. It is a compressor for home, to be kept on the garage wall to be used to add air to the tires ones per month for fuel efficiency, etc.It is a pity that they did not built in a flashlilght into it as it would be helpful if one has to work in a poorly lighted conditions. The screen creates some light, but not quite enough if you use the compressor it in a garage in shadow of the car.The manual is very detailed and clearly written - even though the operation is so simple that one hardly needs the manual.Overall, I think it is a good choice for home use. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:44:22	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

22352155	I bought my Ryobi several years ago. It's performed well all that time. The compact design makes it easy to handle. Belt changes are a snap.

There will be lots of dust on the floor and in the air. The bag fills up pretty rapidly, and it's not easy to clean out.

28820215	This is way overpriced at 99.  It's priced about right at $40.  The drill is as basic as they come. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:54:54	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
50552998	My husband poo-pooed this purchase until he heard the price. He thought it cost over $450.00. I'm so glad that I got it before Amazon ran out. This combo is just about everything a girl could ask for in a tool kit. The circular saw is smaller than Mac's big one and I can do things on my own. We are building a new house and this kit is wonderful.I used it to install 490 sq. ft of floor tile with no problem. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:54:54	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

43201206	I purchased this compressor as a gift for my husband. He has a need for a small compressor around the house for small jobs and some hobby building. This compressor answered his needs very well, and he's very happy with it.It's 6 gallon tank has a fast recovery time from the maintenance-free compressor.It even runs my Ingersoll-Rand impact gun and my Ingersoll-Rand wrench! five stars! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:56:21	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

43698945	This planer is probably the heaviest tool in my workshop, it took 2 people to get it out of the truck without it being dropped. The first month I had it, it left a finish smoother than I could get with sandpaper. But after that first month or so, the blades got fairly dull, and I have been too cheap to replace them, so I've just sanded the boards that come out. But when I got it, the extension tables were almost perfectly set to the planer, I didn't even adjust the blades, and it was perfect. So if you don't mind having to sharpen or replace blades every month or so, you will love this planer. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:56:21	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
36095162	I love this little jigsaw! It cuts a straight cut (as in vertically up and down), it's lightweight, it has a little storage space with a door to hold my most used blades, it has a built in blower to keep the sawdust out of the way and you can't beat the price! I highly recommend this saw for people, like myself, who need a saw for crafts or hobby building. I did buy good quality blades for it. I've had it for several months and still am happy with it. Would also recommend the seller. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:57:25	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
45433788	Love the planner.  For some reason I have a problem with saw dust collecting under the knife which deflects the blade.  I have to remove the blades and clean to get a good flat final pass.  The knife holder itself is bent which speeds the process of dust collection.  I can only guess as to the cause (probably my fault when I did not tighten it down enough before planning).I have read many complaints about the knife life...I planned some old deck boards (treated pine) and destroyed one side of the blade in no time (like 100bf).  I have planned maple and cherry on the other side of the knifes and have planned well over 250bf and still going. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:57:25	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
52696718	This is a GREAT product. The batteries charge very rapidly and Hold the charge for a long time. I store all my tools in a shed outside. I have always had problems with the batteries holding a charge in the NICAD brand. When the Lithium-Ion came about I decided to give it a try since temperture variance does not affect them as bad. So far they have held up great. The Makita brand is a def must have! It is smooth and easy to use. I am very happy with all aspects of the product. I have even ordered a cordless blower that uses the same batteries and currently awaiting its arrival. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 14:57:25	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
31062786	I just put this together and hooked it up to my Powermatic 8 in jointer.

27056132	I've been using this nailer for about a month now, working on finishing my attic.  It certainly makes the job much easier and faster.  I've been through about 1,000 nails so far without a misfire.  Overall quality seems to be excellent.  It's easy to use and to adjust.  My only disappointment is that it did not come with a case, which is the reason for only four stars.  The FR350 is a less expensive model but comes with a case while the FR350MAG comes in a cardboard box. (sigh) 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 15:00:55	Performance Defect		Novice	Yes		false
48279536	This BEFORE I even used it: I had just opened the shipping box when something on the trigger assembly slashed my finger!  The shallow cut was only 1/8#34; or so in length and I hoped that nothing had stuck in my finger.  Right!  I'm a model builder so I had a ready supply of magnifiers, tweezers and medical supplies; it only took about 15 minutes to dig the 1/16#34; x 1/8#34; metal fragment out, and with a little Betadine and a bandaid I was ready to go.  I can't wait to actually use the item... 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 15:00:55	Safety Defect		Expert	Yes		false
30964400	You can run this tool at high speed for a surprisingly long time.....even longer at lower speed. The new battery technology makes that possible.I have a corded Dremel and this new battery power one... Gotta say, I'm partial to the new battery powered unit because there's no cord to get in the way.  However  I did buy  MOTO TOOL FOOT PEDAL for power tools here on Amazon which using a foot pedal, can give you awesome tight speed control of the corded model. makes me feel like I'm some kinda dentist ..just jokin.I'm delighted with the Dremel 8000.... Get one,,, you won't regret it ! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 15:00:55	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
32089221	Bought this drill while I was rewiring several rooms in my house. Got it to drill through floor joists, and it did just that very well. Compact size with good power.The handle/trigger is tricky, and I unplug it before changing bits or if I'm done using it for awhile. Otherwise you're likely to activate the drill accidentally. Did it once, luckily didn't get hurt.But, the length of the trigger is good for one thing. With 2 x 10 joists, I was able to get the drill bit up into the upper part of the joist without having to stick my hand all the way up there. No keyless chuck, but that may be why it's compact. Keyless chucks are about 2-3 times as long as a keyed chuck, so for size issues, I don't mind it here. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 15:00:55	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

22247556	Cons:- Underpowered; The drill would bog down on medium-large jobs.  I wished it had more torque.- Literally underpowered, meaning unpowered; The batteries failed within a year of buying it!Do not buy this.  The batteries will likely fail and if you don't keep the receipt it looks like they will replace them.  Their website kind of sucks too.  I feel burned on Ridgid as a brand.  Also you should be buying a 18v+ drill.  Drill bog is not fun.  I replaced this with an 18v drill and will never go back. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 15:05:42	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false
29868388	Seems to be a good product and does its job, but the cheap, almost useless nozzles/fittings are terrible. I am going to have to go out an buy a nozzle that has a lever to release air because the one that came with it just lets the air go out if the valve is open. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 15:05:42	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
54593287	I got a beat up oily box like everyone else.  The box is pretty big and heavy, so not the easiest of items for UPS to handle.  That being said, the item still works with no leaks (oil or air).  My only complaints so far is that the air filter provided does not fit.  I may call Cal Air Tools and ask if I got the wrong one. Also the oil drain (which is the sight glass) is impossible to loosen as it is recessed and a 7/8#34; socket does not fit.  I am not sure how to remove the oil, I may siphon it off.The item is semi-quiet.  Not sure why so many have complained about the noise.  It is definitely much quieter than belt driven compressors.I did buy this from Amazon Warehouse, so it may have been used already. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 15:05:42	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

48518891	The biggest gripe it have with this is that it's too hard to secure. It has almost no extra plastic around the edges so that you can drill holes and screw it to something stable.

523530	I am a young guy just married and settled into our first house so I needed some new power tools had some older ones that worked for the projects I had when renting an apt. in a city(not much area for building things) I have always like to build and fix things possibly why I became and engineer. I went back and forth between Milwaukee Tool and Dewalt and the more I looked and price as well as pros and cons from contractor friends and mechanic friends one of them said why do you need pro-grade tools yes they work great and last a long time but he said why dont I save some money and look at like black and decker they are lower cost and work fantasic for what I need. So for Christmas my father in law got us the 20v matrix (I say us because my wife and I build and do projects together she also enjoys it) I have used the Drill, Router, cutoff saw and Impact so far on a recent build and they all worked great) the battery has a good life to it ( I did buy a 2nd battery right away though may not have needed it after using it but nice to have) I would highly recommend this for any DIY person. surely I would not build a house with this even a big deck might be a bit too much for it that I would borrow something better from a friend. but its a great tool at a great price. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 15:07:17	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

25986584	This is an outstanding product that exceeds the manufacturers claims.  Dust is limited to almost nothing.  I used it for sanding after scraping popcorn off the ceiling.  If you are living in the house while remodeling, this is a must-have tool.  Of course everything depends on the two stage filtering of the attached vaccum cleaner. I have rented the tool with the Porter Cable vaccum in the past and it worked great.  I used my own vaccum with high efficiency filter and a bag and also worked great.  The sander controlled Porter Cable vaccum is a plus. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 15:08:58	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

55345439	Have been using this planer for about a month now and it has performed flawlessly. I have only used it on White Pine, Red Oak, and Soft Maple so far and it has given a smooth finish on all three species. Still on the first side of the 2-sided HSS cutters but when it's time to replace them I will get a 4-sided carbide set. Definitely a step up from the 2 or 3 straight blade planers at a reasonable price. It's pretty quiet comparatively and seems to be well made. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 15:08:58	No Defect		Novice	No		false

39474703	Was given to me for a Father's day gift.  I am a Mechanic/Locksmith for a institution.  Works great for what I do.  Can go really slow if needed for easy work or fast if you turn more.  The battery life seems to be awesome and very handy.  Actually has a lot of torque however that is not why I suggested or even my need.  I do wish however there was a pocket or belt sheath or pouch since it doesn't quite fit in a pocket but easily a tool pouch.  Also Amazon had the best price anywhere.  This was a new unopened product but used and for the $20 paid for it, I would buy another one in a minute to have at home. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 15:11:33	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

22287257	I was very disapointed with this roofing nail gun because you can't buy nails that work in it.  The nails I order that were suppose to be for this gun did not work.  The gun jamed after every shot.  I called the manufacture of Milwakee tools to find out where I can get the nails for this gun.  They said they stopped making this gun and they didn't know where I could get nails for it.  I went all over looking for nails to fit this gun with no luck.  So if you buy this gun you'll have to use it as a paper weight. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 15:11:33	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

33168799	I really enjoy using this saw.  To my surprise I didn't originally know there was depth stop.  This allowed me to use it to cut dados much like a radial arm saw.  However, you can't put a dado blade in the saw.  At times I have noticed sparks from the motor after excessive use.  Soon I'll be framing a large two story workshop and will put this to the test.Dennis 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 16:02:39	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

27660993	We bought this kit to do pinewood derby work with cub scouts and it works great. It comes with lots of attachments that you typically pay extra for if you were to buy it from Dremel.  The plastic is a little cheaper than some other rotary tools I've seen, but seems to be solid overall.The one negative I have is that the cut-off wheel guard shown in the pictures is not included in the kit.

48907096	I got this item on sale and couldn't be more pleased. Have only used it a couple of times, but used it hard! When grinding and cutting steel there was no slowdown or bogging of the grinder.

42975714	The saw is well-built and light. The storage case (included) is a reasonable quality and has space for a couple of extra blades. The saw is easy to adjust, has good power, and the included blade did a quick job on the tropical hard-wood I used on my deck. Overall the saw represents a good value for the price.

53027015	This planer is a wonderful addition to my collection of Delta woodworking tools.  I purchased 4 days ago and have already run through about 60 bd.ft. of white birch.  The results are among the best I've produced and I can't believe I've attempted furniture building without this machine.  Like most reviewers, I found the 2-speed option mostly trivial and just leave it on the 90 cpi setting.  The manual is quite good (as most Delta manuals are) and I was cutting wood within an hour of bringing it home.  For a perfectly smooth finish, you'll want to take off another 1/64th with a cabinet scraper.  The results using the planer and scraper produced simply luscious results that require me to give this machine 5 stars.  Excellent! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 16:06:54	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

32691193	The Wilton 17202 is a fantastic, high quality machine.  Don't let the few negative comments in other reviews sway you away from this bench grinder.  Yes, the light is a little dim, so what.  Yes, there may me a slight vibration that you can adjust for, so what (I can barely detect a vibration in mine).  Some people had washers installed backwards, so turn them around.  This grinder gets up to speed quickly and takes a LONG time to come to a complete stop (I think this is a mark of quality).I narrowed my choices down to this model and the 8 DeWALT.  I'm VERY glad I purchased the Wilton.  The Wilton costs a little more (roughly $155 compared to $123) BUT, it's more than worth it - here's why:The Wilton is extremely easy to change the grinding wheels on, the DeWALT is very cumbersome to change the wheels on.The Wilton has permanently lubricated bearings, the DeWALT needs to have the bearings periodically lubricated by a service center (an ongoing expense to keep the DeWALT running properly).The Wilton has a much more powerful motor, (7.7 amps for the Wilton compared to 4 amps for the DeWALT).The Wilton includes a wheel dressing tool, the DeWALT doesn't.  Purchasing a dressing tool will cost about $20.00.Wilton and JET are part of the same company.  JET makes even higher quality bench grinders (for a lot more money), and they most likely share technology.  Not sure if the Wilton is a re-badged JET with some changes - I'm speculating here, but I wouldn't be surprised.The Wilton has thumb screws that make it easy to adjust the tool rest distance, tool rest angle (on the 17202), and eye guards.  I don't believe the DeWALT has thumb screws.After factoring in all of these items, the Wilton comes out on top.The sound of the Wilton is great.  It sounds extremely powerful, yet quiet and smooth running (you need to hear it to fully appreciate this).  It was also well packed in the factory styrofoam inside the factory box.  If there is any damage upon arrival, it is most likely due to severe mis-handling by the shipper.  I'm extremely happy with this purchase.  Be extremely careful if you ever need to remove the plastic light shield to change the light bulb as the plastic housing is flimsy and can break easily (this may have happened to the other reviewers).  You need to line up two marks on the light housing to remove the shield without breaking it.  The instructions aren't very good about explaining this, but if you study the light housing in A LOT of detail, you will see the marks.Get the 17202, not the 17205.  The 17205, while it is less expensive, doesn't have the oil/water tray, the dressing tool, and the angle adjustable tool rests (this angle adjustment feature alone makes the 17202 worth the price difference).  From the picture of the 17205, it doesn't appear to have the thumb screws on the adjustable tool rest, and it doesn't appear that the tool rest is made from an aluminum billet like the 17202 (looks like stamped metal instead).Also, looking at the grinder from the side shows the 8 grinding wheel (when it is new) clearing the motor housing by about 1 inch.  Just wanted to include this information in case anyone is concerned about clearance.I'm writing this review because I wish I read something like this from other reviewers so I wouldn't have been apprehensive about this purchase.  Don't worry, about the few negative reviews - you won't be disappointed in this bench grinder.  It's GREAT! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 16:12:05	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
43080358	I drill around 200 holes everyday with the 9-AMP Milwaukee and nothing beats this for a lightweight hammer drill. The Amps don't lie! Go look at the other brands AMPS and see for yourselves. Anyways... I've bought around 6 of these, and have had new brushes put in several times on repairs over the years of coarse. (to be expected with high usage)Do not buy the new style version of this model because, it's total garbage! You have to look for the older 5380-21 model... or you will be sorry! The new version is a lot weaker and it gets hot quick. They don't build anything good anymore. :(Milwaukee, Go back to the previous version please. You're killing me! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 16:12:05	No Defect		Expert	No		false

58630303	This is an amazing sander.  I Build custom furniture (mostly tables) and after much reading I decided to buy this sander and I'm glad I did.  I actually haven't sanded anything with it yet other than some testing I've done with it.  But what I have done has shown me that this is a very effective sander with almost no vibration on the highest setting.  If you run it on a lower speed there is some vibration but as you turn the speed up the vibration lessens and almost disappears on it's highest setting.  It's very smooth and can be easily controlled with one hand.  Ive only tested it with 120 grit so far but the material removal seems great, and I also got no swirl marks.  This is a professional tool for sure.  But it should be for 230 dollars.  I'm really starting to become a fan of Bosch toolsMy only complaint is not with the tool itself but with amazon.  My sander appears to have been used before.  The pad was in excellent condition (brand new) and the tool itself seems fine.  But it definitely had been out of the box before.  There was a gray scuff on the white part of the pad, and the body of the the sander had some marks on it that I had to wipe off, but the dead give away was the tiny lint all over the black rubber grips on the tool which indicated someone had used the tool and then cleaned it up.  There appears to be nothing wrong with it and I don't feel like waiting 2 weeks to get a replacement so I'm going to keep it but I wanted to warn others.  I've read other reviews where people complain about things like this.  I would say if you could buy this locally then do so.  You just don't know what you're going to get with amazon.  I ordered a set of bailey chisels a couple weeks ago and they arrived scattered all over the place lose in the box.  Thankfully the edge guards stayed on them and there was no damage to any of them.  But I really can't rate amazon's service very high because their shipping department sucks and they sell privously used tools before properly cleaning them for resale. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 16:15:14	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false

26007861	So I bought this thing mainly for cleaning out my snake cage. I used it twice before it just quit sucking. No idea what is wrong with it. It does not appear to be jammed or anything. Now it just sits in the corner until I decide if I want to fix it or just throw it out. Don't go the cheap route and get this one.

37365942	While I'm sure there are the name brand buyers out there, I've found this to be an excellent tool. Although I have run a small amount of hardwood through it, it just LOVES working on softer woods (pine and fir, for example) of which I have run quite a few BF in the past couple months.It has yet to produce any snipe, just make sure in the infeed and outfeed tables are set correctly (easily done).The only con is the weight (and it's not REALLY a con as it adds to the quality of the tool and it's production); for a #34;portable#34; bench toptool,this thing is HEAVY.I will defintely belooking at Steel City tools as I expand the shop. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 16:17:11	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
46794950	It's small and light weight, and holds the charge a long time, and works for those hard to get to screwsThis does all those interior decorating jobs that I'm doing while repainting and decorating all the rooms in my house to prepare it for market.

32033067	This is an amazing tool, almost indestructible, and very powerful.  The tool was obviously designed and built to be used.  It domes a great job cutting wood, both hardwood and softwood.  I cut a 1 1/4 piece of desert ironwood as though it were butter.The problem I have with this saw is the lack of ability to do precise curves.  The chip shield is in the way and you can't see the blade.  For straight and larger curves it is amazing but I find it frustrating to try to cut the small tight curves with this saw. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 16:17:11	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
45166564	This is a little gem of a polisher!!  It is lightweight and very easy to handle.  And the price is reasonable.  I'm not much of a car buff -- but even I found this fun and easy to use.  Though it does take some time to cover a large surface.Drawbacks -- the cord is kind of short -- but that's easily remedied with an extension cord, and you probably wouldn't want a super long cord on such a small appliance.  My other gripe-- the little polishing bonnets were pretty hard to get on and off.  And they don't seem like they would hold up very well.Overall, though, a great polisher for the price! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 16:24:24	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
23916065	Had one for 5 years and my son asked for a compressor and nail gun set for home repairs. His set is like mine and have found it to be a very good tool. To get the most out of the nail guns be sure to buy the proper gauge nails and not just the right length. Lighter gauge nails tend to curl around hard spots and grain. Hard to find Porter cable nails here and use other manufacturers  so pay attention to the gauge as they also can not feed properly. I use this compressor to drive a 3 1/8#34; nail framing gun also and it is great. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 16:24:24	Performance Defect		Expert	Yes		false
28535861	I bought this rather than a cheaper one after reading the reviews here about the quality of this one from people who know their tools.  I'm not a wood worker, but I wanted something decent.  This thing worked great right out of the box.  I was able to cut shelves perfectly, I used it for a pretty large  laminate floor project in my house and it went through that very hard surface material really well.  I couldn't be happier.  Goes through that stuff and 1/2 inch plywood like butter.  I was able to cut boards free hand along my line very easily, too. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 16:24:24	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		false

30552927	I've been a building contractor for 25 years and I've always used heavy-duty worm gear saws, but I bought this saw for my daughter when I helped her remodel her condo.  I found I liked it better than my own saw for most work.  No, I wouldn't recommend it for a tradesman or for heavy framing, but for a homeowner it's terrific.  I love the site light.  Had no trouble cutting straight lines, cutting at an angle, notching, whatever.  I just ordered a second one - for my son.

29418008	After looking and talking around, and reading various specs, I decided to order this jewel.  Makita makes good equipment.  I have owned a drill motor, and a palm sander... both are still great after 25 years.  I have no complaints about shipping, no broken parts or lacking setup instructional needs.  With very basic awareness, reading the warning tags, and all the included written infomation, on the few the parts to add, it is easy to be up and quietly running in minutes.  There is also instructional material included for initial breakin start up.  My research led me to oil filled lubrication compressor rather than oil free.  Made sense to me, WOW what a difference.  Quiet... like suprisingly quiet for a typically little noise maker tool.  My brother in law has a small similiar, dry run compressor that is much louder and heavier to carry.  I am nearing my leisure years and carrying weight is a concern.  This Makita gem is just over 50 pounds and easy to carry... good balance.  My brother in laws C/H, seems 25 pounds heavier and is very awkward to lift.  My son has to carry that one around.  CAUTION: This is not a commercial unit for running 2 framing nailers.  It is a very well made homeowner /occasional use quiet tool.  It has only one coupler outlet and as I was advised is not for rapid firing framing nailers continuesly.  I have found no problems running any of my air nailers or my framing nailer at a lesuirely pace.  I imagine it could run my impact tools all right, but I have a larger stationary compressor for those.  I am very happy with this portable compressor and the craftmanship it was built with is obvious.  I would have paid more for this unit now that I have mine.  I got a great deal at $157, here on amazon.  I am very satisfied with this tool and delivery.  This tool would be the ultimate for the hobbyists. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 16:34:03	No Defect		Expert	No		false

22804426	This is the tool that turned me into a blue tool guy!  I have used this thing day in and day out for about two years now.  Have cut everything from pine, oak, hickory, mdf, melamine... you name it!  I use it as a miter box and compound miter, either way it is just as accurate.  Laser is hard to see most of the time but if you really need it you don't need a $500 saw.  It has work supports that extend out more than most and they are pretty stout.  It also has a flip up stop for repetitive cutting and a good extending fence.  The adjustable depth setting is great for cutting dados and notches.  The only downside to this saw is it's HEAVY, trust me you don't want to carry it up a flight or two of stairs everyday.  Make sure you get a strong miter saw stand! 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 16:37:18	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false
49839978	I ordered one of these (directly from Grizzly) because of the great reviews. The first shipment arrived in 2 boxes that showed what I would call normal wear and tear for shipping. When I opened the boxes, the some of the base parts were bent and when I opened the second box, it was apparent that the whole pallet had been dropped really hard. The impact damage had punched thru styrofoam packing and had sheared off the motor housing cap, smashed a number of other parts and scattered loose hardware throughout the box. Because the motor had been impacted so hard, I insisted on a replacement unit. Grizzly tried to get me to agree to accepting a replacement motor that I would have to install. I explained to them that doing free major repair work on a brand new machine was not part of my plans. They eventually allowed me to return the entire unit for an exchange.The second unit finally appeared and the shipping boxes appeared fine. When I opened the boxes, I discovered that this one had also been dropped, but the damage was not as severe as the first shipment, with cosmetic damage to the motor housing cap, a busted fan and table pin. Since I'm running out of time and patience, I elected to keep the saw and request replacement parts. They finally shipped me the package, but it was missing the motor housing cap and the wrong table pin.My conclusion: This may or may not be a good saw, but I have no idea as I have yet to run it. I have been jerked around since my original order was made 6 weeks ago and my patience is now officially at an end. I hope to someday have this up and running, but given their problems with packaging, shipping and customer service, I probably will never-ever order anything else from them. So far this has been about as much fun as getting a root canal. 	hanlynn9	10-26-2015 16:37:18	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		false

38417898	I had purchased numerous 'Craftsman' air tools in the past that did not deliver the power necessary for the tough jobs, and when I pushed them to the limits, they gave out.

45617056	Got this for $115 after $25 discount through DeWalt. I already had 3 18V XRP batteries, so it worked out that I only needed the drill itself.

60663276	This is probably the best 18v cordless set available. When I was shopping I narrowed it down to lithium-ion sets by either Makita or Milwaukee. I ultimately chose Milwaukee because the batteries got slightly better reviews.HAMMER DRILL/DRIVERPROs-All metal chuck-LED light above the hand-grip illuminates the work surface and stays lit for 5 seconds after I let off the trigger. This comes in handy for dimly lit corners.CONs (nothing noted)IMPACT DRIVERPROs-Compact size is very helpful in tight spaces.-LED light above the hand-grip illuminates the work surface and stays lit for 5 seconds after I let off the trigger. This allows me to see what I'm doing as I position the next screw.-The pull-out collar allows for quick bit changes.-Its great to bore pilot holes with the Hammerdrill, and drive screws with the impact driver without having to change between bits on a single drill.CONs-This Impact driver doesn't have a clutch to prevent driving fasteners too deep, but the veriable speed trigger allows for good control. I haven't yet had a need for a clutch, but I'll be cautious when screwing into soft finish-grade material(Think 'a sheet of cork, as a dart-board backer').-I found it to be a little under powered when removing 4 trim screws from stair treads which were glued down. The driver removed 90% of the screws successfully, but there were a few that it couldn't budge. For all other jobs its had plenty of torque.SAWZALLPROs-The quick release for changing blades is the easiest I've ever used.CONs-It drains the battery rather quickly.WORK LIGHTPROs-Surprisingly bright-Fold-out hook is bound to come in handy one day.CONs-I would have liked an LED light instead of Xenon incandescent. That would have made for longer run time on a charge and the LEDs themselves would have lasted much longer than the traditional bulb.BATTERIES and CHARGERPROs-The fuel gauge feature on the battery packs is a definite plus. Just push the button on the battery and it lights up with either 1.. 2.. 3.. or 4 LEDs to show the remaining charge.-Batteries fully charge in one hour.Cons-Occasionally, the battery does not 'seat' properly on the charger and I need to gently push it down for the light on the charger to come on.Note: When I first received this set in the mail one battery charged properly, but the other caused a faulty pack signal when I put it on the charger.  I returned the set to amazon and they promptly mailed me a replacement set.Just remember to pull out the charger and batteries try charging both of them before unpacking the rest of the set.ConclusionOverall I am very pleased with this set.  I highly recommend it for both Professionals and Home owners.You can plan on spending about $40 to $80 on drill bits, Sawzall blades, screw driver bits, nut drivers, spade bits etc.Note: Avoid driver bit sets labeled Impact Ready. The 1 inch bits go into the extender easy enough, but removing them requires brute strength and a pair of pliers. Stick with buying small sets of 2 inch philips, square, torques, and nut diver bits and combine them in a generic case.  The 2 inchers are designed to fit in the impact  driver without an extender. 	znohel	01-31-2016 09:22:40	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true

28892783	I bought this based on its low price but I had to return it immediately because of a problem with the chuck.  I bought a comparable corded 3/8 inch drill of the DeWalt line (D21008K) instead-- more expensive but clearly money better spent, in retrospect.As an example, look at the chuck's outer rings (where I had a problem): it is made out of plastic.  The DeWalt version is aluminum there, feels more mechanically rock solid, and it is thoughtfully larger in diameter (so you can clamp/unclamp with a higher gripping torque).  (The DeWalt has a higher rated power-- but I'm just comparing how trustworthy the designs are.)At about $30 for this Black and Decker I think you get what you pay for-- it otherwise looked fine, and I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt for the rest.(By the way, this one of my very rare product return experience with Amazon, and I applaud how painless they make that, even with a non-media item like this!) 	znohel	01-31-2016 09:48:19	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true

60342686	When my older NiCd battery (Versapak) died after 10 years of intermittent household use, I looked around for replacement batteries first. At thirtfive dollars, they exceeded the price of a new BD; drill with Lithium batteries. Also having used a friend's drill with Li batteries, I knew these to be a workhorse and quick to recharge. So, at tthe replacement drill arrived, via Woot, and I took a chance on a refurbished one with the usual 2-year warranty from BD.; At twelve plus five for shipping, it was an acceptable deal. The drill arrived today and it does not look any different from a brand-new one - no scratches, the power supply seems to be in pristine condition. The charging light stopped blinking in about one hour and in the evening, I was able to use it to drill holes in the drywall to hang a curtain.Yes, it does not have variable speed or a light that would show up the place being drilled better. If you accept those as minor inconveniences, this tool is worth every cent, refurbished or new. The old drill would be now donated. 	znohel	01-31-2016 09:51:48	No Defect		Expert	No		true

Initially I was pleased with the drill, it is light, compact, and ergonomic. The problem is about 30% to 40% of the time the battery will be dead when it is left in the charger. The green light will be on indicating that it is completely charge, but it is not. It seems to be getting progressively worse. I'm not a novice, and I know proper battery maintenance protocol. I've owned Dewalts, Panasonics and Milwaukees and have never had this problem. In checking the reviews I see that others have this same problem, and apparently Makita batteries are often troublesome. I'll keep using it despite this flaw, but I'll never buy another MakitaPOS again. Why play Russian roulette with your money and hope you get one that is reliable, there are plenty of good quality tools to choose from, By the way, 10 minutes ago I bought a Bosch cordless drill and grinder. 	znohel	01-31-2016 09:57:51	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
37216147	From the wife's point of view, this is an excellent product!  We had to grind paint off of a 60 foot retaining wall that spanned our new master bedroom, master bath, living room, main bath, and laundry room.  We're living in this house, and thankfully we could still live in it during the process.  This dustless system saved us a lot of clean up and unhealthy air since the dust was vacuumed up before it got out into the air.  My hubby did make a few tweaks on the dust shroud for his grinder in order for it to fit right, but this was a true blessing! We plan to utilize more attachments as we progress onto drywall and other things. PS: My hubby as well as our builder were also pleased with this product, so it wasn't just me. :) 	znohel	01-31-2016 09:57:51	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
42454679	I have had this drill for over a year and use it quite a bit.  I have a much heavier 18V Bosch Brute Tough drill with the big NiCad batteries that I used as a plumber, when not at work I prefer to use this much lighter 12V Dewalt.  The Dewalt feels much better in my hands.  The compact size and built in light has been great for tight spots and hanging cabinets.  2 1/2 screws have been no problem for this drill but 3 can be a struggle without a pilot hole. Seems to be quite durable as well.  I dropped this drill off of my roof onto the deck the first weekend I had it.  Did not seem to phase it at all since that was a year ago and has shown no signs of slowing down. 	znohel	01-31-2016 09:57:51	No Defect		Expert	No		true

46926636	Ordered the item to replace an older Senco that gave up the ghost.  Selected the Porter Cable model based upon on-line reviews and reviews in WOOD magazine.  I use this size nailer on many of my projects and, although I've only used it a few times since ordering, it's lived up to it billing.  The adjustable depth control took some getting used to and I was able to get satisfactory depth control by increasing the air pressure in the compressor.  I'd definitely order the same nailer again.  Delivery was timely and met/exceeded my expectations. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:01:44	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

31648992	I already had one and wanted a second. I had tried another manufacturer and didn't like their 18 volt system and so I gave it to my daughter and son-in-law who won't need to use it as much.

37869193	Bought my hatchet a few years ago on cleanance at Sears. I use it to prune and clear branches and small bushes away from my grass dumping area. Orbital setting really helps speed things up cutting wood. This feature(orbital) is nice considering the short (3/4)stroke the hatchet has.

Got it to broach key ways on the inside of pulleys that I have needed to bore out to fit the new shaft size.  It does what I needed, is all I care.

55030493	I love this drill driver. It is light weight and compact a has plenty of power. I was looking for good drill driver that did not weight a ton. I have a Ryobe drill that is good at what was billed as, a drill and does a good job at it. The problem was that it weighed a ton (slight exageration) thus not making as a driver unless you lift a lot of weights. A friend had a Makita drill driver. After using his I was hooked and it comes with two lithium batteries. My wife being the intuitive sort, bought for me for my birthday! 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:03:32	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

40532103	I have used this driver for the last eight years as well as some others on the market, nothing will beat this unit.

52890151	The band saw arrived in good condition without any damage or missing parts.  Assembled in about 15 minutes and did not need any adjusting.  It works well, fairly quiet and with enough power to do the job.  The laser and LED lights are a nice touch, but not really that useful. The case is plastic, so it may not last for decades, but the unit is well worth $100. This is not a top of the line band saw, but it is better than I expected for the price.  Overall, I am happy with the purchase and would recommend to others. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:05:44	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
54130713	this is a good tool but during the setup including confirmation of zero and 45 degree bevel angles I found the included manual to be poorly edited.the illustrations are much too small for anyone but a very myopic (nearsighted) person who could hold them 6 inches from their eye. Nearly useless for identifying small control knobs etc. The text and illustrations are not in the same position on the page always.A fine company like Makita should be ashamed of this manual.Jim 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:05:44	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
49393713	This is a great very versatile product with the heft that gives it a solid feel of something durable that will last.  The tool attachments are also of high quality and easy to change and the included tool bag nicely provides for a convenient organizing and transporting feature in this all-inclusive kit.  Considering how much the individual attachments cost, this 72-piece kit is the way to go.  The tool that's provided with this kit is the variable speed model that's supposed to provide for maximum flexibility in various applications, but I've yet to use any setting other than the highest speed.  The 10-foot cord is also nice in that it sometimes allows for use without the need for an extension cord.  If you're in the market for an oscillating tool and know what jobs this tool was intended for, this one will fit the bill. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:05:44	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

54021741	Putting my 2 cents in as I'm shocked this thing isn't getting more 5 star reviews.  It's tough, Milwaukee has a great line of impact hex attachments for it that all come in one kitMilwaukee (48-32-4402) 35 Piece Milwaukee Shockwave Impact Duty Drill Bits and Driver Bitsand fit in the driver instantly without any play, and the belt attachment is really handy.  Yes, it only works with the m18 batteries... get over it.

56423637	The belt was what I expected but not what I needed. I took a chance due to the price  the fact that if it turned out to be what I expected I could use for another compressor that I had.

50674196	I just recieved this and tried it.  The impact driver is loud (excpected) and very slow.  Reviews from other sources speak well of it, but it seems to be under powered.  It may be good for very light finish work, but nothing else.  In fact the drill will drive put a 3 screw into a 2x4 FASTER than the impact driver.  So buy the drill and save money.

30953206	Let me start off by saying that I am not in an industry that would require I use this nor am I a tool junkie.I would say I am your average guy with less than average tool usage.  ;)So this review is for people like me.First off, this only comes with a couple of bits.  None of which I had any use for, or at least I thought.  I went out and purchased a couple RotoZip Metal Zipwheel Discs in order to work on the couple projects I had in mind.  We live in a older home which we rent and in between carpeted to tile areas it has those metal strips.  These things have bugged me since we moved in.  I have tried everything short of ripping them up and replacing them to smooth them out.The rotozip fixed this problem in less than 5 minutes.  I found it satisfying to really fix the problem.So I went in search of other things I could do with this thing while I was playing.  Our kitchen has these older metal cabinets with one of those old ceramic or whatever sinks, you know the kind that has the huge basin and then the counter top to its left and right are all one big piece and drain into the sink.  Well at some point someone tried to fix the doors and they must have done it with the sink off because the access to the screws they used was blocked by it.  What makes this bad is that they just kind of rigged these doors so they never actually want to stay closed.With the rotozip I was able to cut these screws in half and let them all out and then use some fasteners I had in the house for just such a thing but couldn't use them due to the screws being in the way.Chalk another problem solved by the rotozip.After that I put it away thoroughly satisfied with myself.Since that day I have used this thing on a number of projects that I never would have probably tacked had this tool not been in the house. (I am sure I have used it for things that I could have gotten by without it too. lol)I have put access holes in walls to run some speaker wire, cut a new hole in a storm door to adjust the thing that keeps it closed.  Yeah, I don't know what its called. ;)I love having this thing around the house.That being said, its not super powerful but it does get the job done.  I do try to not stress it by over revving it, but thats just me, its probably fine anyways.It does get a little warm at times too.I didn't use the dust management system.  The bag is nice and convenient for me as I don't really have a tool area so I store it in its bag rather than likely throwing it in a box with the cord wrapped around it.All in all this is a great thing to have around the house.  I haven't really found any faults for what it is though like I said before I am not a tool person, its just worked well for what I have needed it for. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:15:47	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
45802708	This is my first Milwukee tool purchase.  I am very pleased with the ease of use and smoothness of the plunge mechanism.  The weight is not to heavy and the tool feels well balanced when in use.  I have only routed pine and did notice the motor to bog down a little with a deep 3/4 inch cut, but it performed well leaving a nice cut.  Of coarse, I only made such a deep cut to test what the router could handle.  Be careful when laying the router down on its side if still plugged in.  I accidently layer the tool partially on a clamp which depressed the switch and turned the motor on.  I like this tool so much that I will pursue other Milwukee tools in the future 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:15:47	No Defect		Novice	No		true

The first one is about 10 years old, the second is the newer generation like the one shown.They're fairly quiet, comfortable to hold (a lot of vibration makes your hand go numb- not with these!), and heck, they even look good on your workbench!Easy to change sandpaper, or buy an adapter kit and switch to hook and loop (er... Velcro?)...Well worth the money!!! 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:19:01	No Defect		Expert	No		true
41442305	I got this for free as part of a deal with aSkil 2372-01 7.2-Volt Li-Ion Power Wrench.  I am so happy that I did not spend money for this.  Don't get me wrong - it drives screws for very small projects.  Its size makes it extremely handy, but be prepared to use your own muscles to finish tightening in at least half of your projects.  It's funny because sometimes it over tightens in lighter projects.  The lack of a clutch really limits what I will try to do with this.  I ended up getting a new battery for myBlack and Decker PD600 Pivot Plus 6-Volt Nicad Cordless Screwdriver with Articulating Headthat I've had for years.  It's not as small as the iXO, but the clutch, 6 volts, and drill function make it that much more versatile.  The iXO is packaged with the short stubby bits that are common with these types of tools which makes it impossible to get into narrow spaces that a normal, thin, screwdriver can.  The extension that comes with it is pretty thick.  I ended up using longer quick release bits from a Black and Decker kit that I have.  Overall, this tool is good to have in the arsenal, but very unnecessary if you have anything similar to theBlack and Decker PD600 Pivot Plus 6-Volt Nicad Cordless Screwdriver with Articulating Headthat has a clutch and a good old fashioned screwdriver. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:19:01	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
45296906	After going 10 years with a Dewalt, I spent the next four years hoping from one cordless piece of junk to the next.  Tried most of them, BlackDecker;, ToolShop, . . . and frankly either the battery life wasn't there OR the actual torque capability didn't live up to the marketing torque specs.Bought this kit primarily for the drill driver.  I've had it for a few months and absolutely love it.  It has as much torque as the DeWalt but being Li-on, the torque is there to the end of the battery charge.  I am a serious hobbiest so don't use the tool every day.  The battery doesn't lose it's charge over non-use.  Drilled 40 pilot holes and put in 40 3 screws after sitting in the box for 2 weeks and the drill ran great with plenty of residual charge.Love my Milwaukee! 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:19:01	No Defect		Expert	No		true

55826305	I purchased this router because I decided I wanted to make my own kitchen cabinets.  I have 2 other Porter Cable routers which didn't have the HP to handle the larger bits needed for the raised panel doors.  I also purchased a JessEm Masr R Lift to handle the heavy router. What a combination. The router exceeded my expectations.  With the variable speed I was able to safely control the speed of the larger bits.  The router had more than enough power to handle anything I could throw its way.  It cut through the oak like it was butter..  The router arrived a few days later than I expected it but was extremely well packaged.  This router is a real workhorse.  It wasn't any louder than my other router and never over heated with constant use.  I would highly recommend this router.  I checked all over the internet and at other woodworking stores and couldn't find it any cheaper than Amazon.  Well worth the investment. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:21:49	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

35212852	I have wanted a variable speed drill press for some time, as I was tired of changing the belts every time I needed to adjust the speed.  I was hesitant about buying the Delta, as most good variable speed drill presses are twice as expensive.  Having given up on trying to locate a used commercial machine, I took the plunge and purchased the Delta.As soon as I put it together the first thing I checked was run-out.  I was pleasantly surprised when I found I had only .001.  The run-out did not change even when I extended the quill.  As you can imagine I was beaming at that point.  Next test was vibration.  Again, surprised, I had little vibration.  I am sure with a heaver castings, I would have less; but I could not complain about what I had, it was nominal.All in all, I was very pleased/surprised with my purchase as I think Delta in some cases has sacrificed quality to bring it's product in at a lower price point. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:21:49	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

29992086	I am giving this 5 stars for what it is. There really is nothing else to compare it to and if you do you are mistaken. Just make sure it will do what you need it to do.I like the review by Ethan however I would like him to reconsider his rating on the review I believe it should be a 4 star or 5 star because the things he didn't like about this where simply features that are part of this model number.1.) The Lock-On Paddle Trigger: This is a feature of this model number 6146-30. You can buy a variant of this grinder in model number 6146-31 and 6147-31 that DO NOT HAVE the Lock-On Paddle Trigger. If Ethan had simply bought one of these other variants his issue with the lock would be non-existent.2.) The longer spindle of the 6146-30: This model and the 4 other variants of this model all have this as it's actually done on purpose as a feature. These grinders can literally use nearly ALL types of accessories that exist for 4 and 4.5 inch angle grinders. In order to accomplish this and maintain SAFETY the spindle has to be longer. I personally believe Milwaukee did a good job compensating for this by over-sizing the nut and making this a NEW feature by knurling the metal this allows you to remove the nut WITHOUT TOOLS. Granted the 6146-30 comes with a spanner wrench the fact is you do not have to use it. In fact one of the over variants doesn't even have a spanner wrench included and if you check out replacement parts for this model you will find the spanner wrench is discontinued by the manufacturer according to some.3.) It's larger size. I noticed Ethan is okay with this but isn't thrilled about it. Again this is for a good reason. More powerful motor than most other grinders out there. Why? Same reason as number 2; because it can use all those accessories and they will cause great wear and tear on this unit they needed a motor that could do the job and last. This is also why it has the Overload Protection, Electronic Clutch, New Airflow System and the slow start. All of these things in combination allow you to SAFELY operate this unit with ALL those accessories.Not all angle grinders out there can do what these units can do. Some are specifically designed to only use certain types of accessories as they don't have beefy arbor bearings and some cannot handle a lot of downward pressure like when you are using wire brushes.For what this unit was DESIGNED to do it does it well. Like all things you cannot have your cake and eat it too. You have to sacrifice some things in order to gain others. I think this is actually a very well rounded angle grinder and I believe Home Depots choice to carry this unit made sense not only because more Home users buy from there but it's Milwaukee's kit that comes with a grinding wheel. A bargain for the home owner.Could Milwaukee have made the model without the lock as a kit with a wheel yes but flip a coin. It's a feature and as long as you get use to it there shouldn't be any issues.So I beg Ethan to rethink his basis to give this a 3 star I don't think it deserves it as really Ethan could have bought a version that wouldn't have some of the issues he stated. In fact there are other angle grinders from Milwaukee you could pick up at Grainger that would have everything he needs.I just bought one of these today because my DeWalt and Skil were not up to the job. Originally I was going to get either the Maketa or the Bosch but after seeing the other features and the power of the motor I was sold on this unit.Personally the whole made in China issue becomes less of an issue daily. More manufacturers have stuff made in China and even if it's not assembled there many of the parts are made there. Not much we can do about it. It sucks for other reasons but basing quality off being made in China isn't an accurate gauge anymore. It really depends on the quality control of the company itself. Go with a company that will stand behind the product and one who cares about quality control.I would recommend this to anyone who needs a powerful angle grinder that won't KICK out of your hand when you start it and it will serve for multiple purposes making it a well rounded grinder. If you don't need the power then save some money and get the less expensive Maketa and you will be happy. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:24:48	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
46457913	This is by far my favorite tool. I have used it to do everything while repairing a house that had not been taken care of for 20 years. HVAC, cabinetry, plumbing, siding, fence, I mean everything that required a fastener. I also have the DeWalt DC900KL hammer drill and even though the hammer drill is a 36 volt this little 18v is much more powerful. Also the batteries last an exceptionally long time. This tool is also small (at least to me) and can get in places where some drills, including my right angle, can'tThe only thing you can't do is drill holes with this unless you have quick change drill bits. However those bits are more expensive than regular ones. The solution for this is an adapter that will fit in the shaft and act as a keyless chuck. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:24:48	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
59006657	I have never used a router before, but I really like this one.  The variable speed works really well, I do not get any burn marks on the wood.

24728983	I bought this drill some time ago, and have used it quite a bit. I have several cordless drills, but find a good corded drill very handy to have.  It seems like every time I want to drill a hole, the cordless drill batteries all need charging.  With this Black and Decker corded drill I just plug it in and drill away.  For the money this drill is a great deal. It has plenty of power, is durable and works every time.  I highly recommend this drill. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:28:44	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

24320261	The drill is nice for a purse, but not on the job site.  The gyroscopic screwdriver is cute but when you really need the power you want a solid trigger. The battery life was not impressive either, my used 7.2 volt Dewalt battery last longer  than the new 8 volt battery did. It also does not seem to have as much power either as the 7.2 Dewalt drill does.Therefore if you want one for around the house this would be great, but not recommended for use in the professional trades. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:32:36	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true

28287677	I love this thing.  I am not good with using a drill as a screw driver and a drill gets heavy for me for a longer project.  I recently assembled a chest of drawers; it took me about eight hours and it has a LOT of screws.  The battery on this little screwdriver just kept chugging along; it did not need to be recharged.  It is lightweight and turns at just the right rate of speed for me.  Many years ago I had the type of cordless screwdriver with a straight handle, this pistol grip is much more ergonomically sound, much easier to work with, especially for the long project I did.  And I love the stay-on bit holder--bits don't get lost.  This is a nice piece of equipment and worth every cent paid for it. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:34:15	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

58551626	I've wanted one of these drills for over a year, but couldn't bring myself to spend the money. But, I broke down during the Bosch tool sale last summer and got one. Glad I did too, because there's no limit to what it will do. I've used it to install plumbing and wiring and duct work in places where no other drill or driver will fit. I drilled one inch holes for water line with a spade bit through a double plate between floors in no time. My 8 amp Porter-Cable right angle drill would never go into the places this little Bosch drill does. It's great for installing and removing gutter hangers, too. I love the dial speed control, especially for running screws. Don't overload this tool. With 3.8 amps, it has medium power, but the size and shape make up for that. It's true beauty is it's close quarters capabilities. This tool is a must have for remodelers and handy persons. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:34:15	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

41839061	This vacuum is compact and has great suction. Considering its price I have been impressed by it's performance. It does, however, have a few drawbacks: The power cord is short, so it almost always requires an extension cord. The wheels on the bottom fall off quite easily and the vacuum itself is prone to tipping over. The attachments are okay, but they don't always lock on super securely. Finally,the system for storing attachments on the top of the vacuum is a bit awkward and insecure. If you don't mind dealing with these fairly minor frustrations, then you'll be happy with this vacuum. 	znohel	01-31-2016 10:38:46	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true

35106004	My grandparents had a 50 year old terrazzo shower base that had never been maintained as expected (sealing every 2-3 years). SO when I started this project, there were several areas of erosion (cementious materials had eroded leaving marble chips exposed) where 50 years of water had done damage. I had to initially purchase a additional #30 grit pad, but after that I had everything needed to repair/restore the surface of the terrazzo to original surface condition.

49226328	The Delta 50-760 is the first dust collector I have used. At first I was undecided between the single stage type (Delta 50-760) or a cyclone 2 stage type. Good reviews and price decided me on the Delta. If you are using a single machine at a time the Delta is more than enough. Its small footprint and wheels make it simple and convenient to move from machine to machine. The greatest chip maker I have is a 12 jointer/planer combination machine. The Delta has no problem keeping up with jointing or planing a full width 12 board. In addition the 1 micron filter is definately a health benefit. A grest dust collector and I have no reservations about recommending it. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:05:17	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
38720573	DeWalt's trying to position this saw as the best price/performance option between the lower cost contractor's saws, and the more expensive cabinet saws from Delta and Powermatic.  There is a gap in the market there, but this saw's not the answer.It has some plusses.  The design is a big improvement over most contractor's saws, with the engine cleanly beneath the table, the oversized on/off switch in a place where the saw can be quickly shut down without distraction.  The motor has been sufficient to rip 3 purpleheart when combined with a Forrest II blade.It has considerably more serious drawbacks.First, and most important, the fence is very poor.  It's made out of stamped steel and aluminum, and the design is such that there are strains in every direction based on the cam and the torx screws.  It's extremely difficult to align the fence, and once done, the fence creeps out of alignment after just a few cuts.  And no table saw can be better than its fence.  I removed the factory installed fence and replaced it with a Biesemeyer.Second, the stamped wings are cheesy, and designed that they can't really be set up so they're flush and flat.  It may appear like it's an upgrade from your old Craftsman or contractor's saw, but it's not.  I re-machined one of the wings after adding some bracing, and built a cabinet with melamine top for the other side.Third, the dust collection is very poor.  The small pipe (it really should be a 4) is just kind of stuck there, and installed at an angle, so dust collection setup is both difficult and ineffective.  I built a collector out of old vacuum attachment, and hooked it up to my 4 pipe.  It's not perfect, but it's at least acceptable now.Fourth, the blade guard and kickback pincers are extremely cheesy.  A behind-the-blade splitter is not available on the aftermarket.  You will be tempted to just remove the mechanism, something we all do but shouldn't.  I use a rigged up set of Grip-Tites that I bought here on amazon as a blade guards and anti-kickback pawls.In short, I wanted to get a cabinet saw, decided to save the money and go with the 746 Woodworker's Saw.  Instead of saving me money, I've spent in excess of $700 on upgrades, and countless hours to create a saw that's effective, reliable, and safe.  I should have remembered my first Woodworking Instructor's advice that Only rich people can afford to buy inexpensive tools.  It's been a great learning experience, but I wanted a great saw, not a lesson.I would advise people to either save up for a Powermatic 66, or buy used.  There are really great used saws available; a used Delta Unisaw or Powermatic would be a far better purchase than this offering. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:05:17	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true

28370136	Cruisin with power tools.  One can never have enough.  Forgot about how important it was to control the dust(MDF) stands for quot;man-made dust factoryquot;.  Although I could have used a larger unit, I can only use one machine at a time.  It has got to be better than a shop vac.  It is definitely a whole lot queiter.  Static pressure is lower but volume is tremendously greater.  I might be able to find what is left of my basement yet! If you love wood, than get one of these before you change your mind because of the dust. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:05:17	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
33219296	I bought this angle grinder as a X-mas present. I have asked my son-in-law how it has performed or worked and he says it hasn't missed a beat yet.

55751821	I bought the TRE550 to use installing crown molding around the soffitt on my front porch. The molding is soft 3/8 pine and the facia board is poplar. This unit is supposed to handle 1/2 and 5/8 brads but it could not set 5/8 brads without leaving them sticking up around 1/4. The last thing I wanted while working overhead was having to try to set all these little brads with a hammer and set punch. I have returned this unit to Lowes and ordered the more powerful TRE650 which is supposed to set up to 1 1/4 brads in most woods. I'm hoping it will at least handle 5/8 brads on the crown molding job. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:09:44	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
55016044	I've searched a long time for a small sander like this.  This one is high quality and a perfect size for miniature woodworking.

46493019	I have had this gun for about 2 weeks.  It is very easy to use, feels good in my hand, does an excellent job.

347647	I purchased this drill after the batteries on both of my cordless drills died.  I was not ready to pony up and pay 40+ for another battery on drills that were average.  Even though this drill has a cord it is AWESOME!!  It has plenty of power for your drilling needs and feels really good in your hands.  I also purchased the reciprocating tool with it but have not used it yet.  I love the fact that I can purchased multiple Matrix tools for different jobs.  I am now going to grab the cordless version and then I will have the best of both worlds!! 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:12:15	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
37685732	Before I get into the actual product, a quick review of CPO Dremel. The refurb tool was in perfect condition - if it were not for the sticker on the handle that said it was a refurb, you'd think it was brand new. The blade, flexible scraper and sanding attachments were brand new and sealed in plastic. The major differences are that it comes in a plain brown box, and there's only a 1 year warranty instead of the 2 years you get with a new unit. Good way to save a few bucks -- when I ordered it the price was quite a bit lower than the new one.  Prices change a lot, however, so be sure to compare before buying.The Multi-Max is a very useful tool provided you understand its limitations. It's perfect for homeowner use, and is incredibly handy for jobs such as making a plunge cut into wood or drywall, undercutting trim when installing flooring, removing grout and peeling off caulk. Those are the tasks I've used it for and each time I've been very pleased with the ease of use and the final results. Makes me look like I'm a much better carpenter than I actually am!I've had no problems whatsoever with the blade coming off like some have reported. There's a phone number listed in a FAQ on the Dremel site if you want to get a better washer assembly (they send it to you for free). So far I've not had the need for it - just make sure the washer is situated properly (there are stickers and notices all over the tool and instruction manual telling you how to position it) and tighten the holding bolt down firmly. Zero problems for me after hours of use. But, I'll probably call them to get the better washer system just in case it's needed down the road.It is not a tool that can withstand the hard and heavy use that a professional contractor or carpenter dishes out. There's a reason that the Fein costs so much more - it's built to withstand much heavier duty than the Dremel. I doubt this would last more than a few months in the hands of a contractor who uses it every day. For the typical homeowner, however, it's a fantastic way to get 95% of the benefits of a Fein at a fraction of the price.  More than sturdy enough for typical homeowner use around the house.I went with this versus the Rockwell mainly since the Dremel blades are a lot easier to find. You can get them on Amazon or, if you need one immediately, you can find them at the big box stores.Usage tip: don't force the tool - let it do the work. You'll get a much cleaner cut and you'll extend the life of the blade.Update June 2011: I've had this for nearly 2 years and it's still going strong. Just used it the other day to cut out a damaged wood floor slat to replace it. Perfectly clean cut -- no way I could have done it without this. Going through oak flooring took some time even with the metal/wood blade, but it made it. Zero problems to date, and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat. I'd still like to get a Fein since I love the way those work and feel, but this gets the job done for a whole lot less. It's not contractor grade-tough as a Fein, but really handy for homeowner-grade use. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:12:15	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
50040026	Great little finish compressor.  Quiet, can use inside with no problem at all, and still talk over the noise.  Builds up pressure fairly quick with built in regulator. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:12:15	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

44612285	I have used this many times on oak shoe trim.  It has never jammed and drives the pin fully (even the really long pins) as long as you hold the gun firmly.  I put my second hand on top of the piston holding part of the frame to apply extra pressure.  The loading mechanism works well. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:14:18	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
52317956	This is a nice affordable drill.  Lightweight and powerful.  No, it is not a 1/2 Milwaukee Magnum, but those are heavy and expensive.  Mine came with the all-metal chuck featured on the D21009, so they must have ditched the plastic chuck.  The only thing I would like is an adjustable torque to make it a driver as well.  This thing will blow through a lot of stuff with a screw-driver bit--and I hate cordless tools (actually I hate the need to continue buying new batteries). 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:14:18	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true

52829259	Not quite sure what they were going for with this one.  Felt too big to be a trim router but too small to be a full size machine.

31289719	I've been looking for an electrical screwdriver for some time. I was willing to pay more in order to buy something that would last longer. So I bought this PS40. I don't have it for a long time, but I am very happy with it. Around the house is everithing I need. I also bought a set of bits/drills/.. (Bosch CC... something, I forgot what is was). Together they are perfect. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:16:10	No Defect		Novice	No		true
26732032	Excellent product.  I'm a seamstress and couldn't do without it.  One problem.  The battery doesn't remain charged long enough and I'm never sure how long I can keep it on charge -= overnight or only a few hours.  Could use guidance on minimum and maximum times for ideal charging.One further suggestion, this item should be sold in fabric stores and not just at Christmas time - all year long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thanks,Maureen Edickmaureenedick@gmail.com 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:16:10	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true

23474022	These routers kick [posterior]!  Even though there are some otherrouters with higher horsepower ratings, I have cut rail and stile profiles in one pass and I don't have to go really slow either. As for raised panel cutting, I don't have the vertical bits, but rather a 2 3/4quot; dia horizontal bit, so I use 2 passes for safety reasons.Excellent adjustment mechanism as well! 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:16:10	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

57570210	I wanted to get one of the best and was very disappointed. The chuck doesn't tighten down on bits tight enough and it isn't designed with a hand tighten mechanism.Almost every time I pull the trigger to drill or wrench the loose clutch adjustment moves to another setting.I'll give this to my wife to keep at her dance studio, maybe it will work out OK for her to drill holes in drywall to hang awards and pictures. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:18:47	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
45268311	I've been looking for a small router for small jobs (mainly routing small roundovers and chamfers) on projects, so that I could leave my big router in the table.Pros:1.  Easy to adjust.  The adjusting ring moves smoothly and it's easy to get the perfect depth of cut.2.  Well built.  I prefer the feel of this to the equivalent Porter-Cable model3.  Spindle lock!  It's nice to not have to mess with two collet wrenches.4.  The LED's are handy for lower-light situations.Cons:1.  Would've been nice if it came with a case.2.  Can't change the bit without removing the motor from the base.  Not a big deal though, so I'm not even deducting a star. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:18:47	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

49667134	For basic home projects, the guns are great. Easy and work well. The compressor itself is fairly quiet compared to large ones and fills quickly. I can fill it, unplug the device and walk around my home spraying out the PC, check the tires, and anything else inside before it needs to be refilled. We have a newborn so I don't want it running inside. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:18:47	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

27564064	Don't be too put off by the instructions -- they read like a prescription drug disclaimer -- there's very little about how to use the compressor -- they're all about how not to use it. Instructions notwithstanding, the compressor worked as advertised coming to a tank pressure of 150 psi within a minute, or so (after I closed the drain valve, which arrived open). It's certainly not whisper quiet but it's not deafening either. The gauges can become slightly misaligned but it's no big deal straightening them. The regulator works well and allows you to avoid overinflating/bursting items (like skinny bike tires). The tire chuck provided with the compressor is so stubby that's it's a bit hard to use -- I ordered (from Amazon) a Milton S693 chuck for $12 and it solved my problem with the stubby chuck. The $159 price is outweighed by the convenience of not having to drop a bunch of quarters into the local gas station's compressor and then rushing around hoping that you can get to all four tires before the compressor times-out. I'm sure I'll find a lot of things to do with the Porter-Cable unit other than just inflating car tires. I must admit that I applied $150 of gift cards to the purchase so I only paid $9 -- I might have been a little reluctant to spend the whole $159 just for the convenience. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:22:16	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
52794701	We are working on some furniture pieces and I love this sander.  It works great, easy to use, and the sheets are easy to take on and off.  The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't catch the dust that well.  For $30 bucks though I didn't really have that much expectation that it would. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:22:16	Performance Defect		Indeterminate	Yes		true
38528092	The wrench is on of the best products that I have. It is fast, holds a long charge and helps get into places that other tools can not. It would take 10 times longer for a regular ratchet wrench to do the same job. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:22:16	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
22168549	I purchased this to go in my service vehicle. As long as there is an electrical outlet, I will have air. It pressures up quite nicely and shuts off when it is supposed to. Perfect for maintenance of machinery and equipment. The tank is a nice size as well and it powers my air-tools no problem, even the impact. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:22:16	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
30463321	Super fast shipping.  Arrived the next day.  I just vacuumed out my car and I was impressed by the power of the vac.

54030207	Purchased this jigsaw for my Father. Since then it has been used on multiple projects including replacing a floor in a trailer and cutting through 19/32 floor boards, multiple 3/4 MDF projects as well as different types of metals. Cuts through them without an issue, and the blower is nice to keep the dust out of the way. It holds a few blades on the jigsaw itself which is helpful. Excellent jigsaw for small to medium projects but not for any type of commercial use. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:25:03	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
32147896	This is a great all in one product.  Now I can get rid of the many individual items and replace it with this one. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:25:03	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
34577696	A really solid product for the fireplace. Small enough to tuck away in a closet or near a stove/insert. I keep it plugged in near an insert to clean up little ash messes before they get spread around. Decent suction that doesn't fade out as you suck up a lot of ash. If you've ever set a shop vac filter on fire, or worried about a coal burning through the bottom of one, and don't want to spend 300 on a big professional unit, this is the unit for you. Smells a but funny when it's running a while, but don't think it matters much. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:25:03	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true
48179601	I bought this at HD and used it to sand an old wood decorative shelf.  Works fine for the detail work, but large areas of wood went faster when I sanded them by hand.  Use the 60 grit sandpaper, and then just finish with the 150 to smooth it off as a last step. 	znohel	01-31-2016 11:25:03	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

41505442	I bought this shop vac back in 2004. I was building and remodeling houses at the time. It got a lot of heavy daily use and abuse. Now it cleans up the House, Truck, Garage and Koi Pond. It gets used weekly. It gets pet hair that is deep in the carpet. When I get my truck washed at a commercial place I bring it home and take this vac to it to get the job done right. People are always amazed at how strong and quiet this machine is. Still works like a champ 6 years later. 	rgruss	04-21-2016 10:19:23	No Defect		Indeterminate	No		true

I can hear no leaks so I'm guessing the compressor itself is leaking internally.It took UPS 5 days to deliver the unit and it is now Saturday and the Porter Cable repair center is closed.I'll take it in on Monday.

58036078	I purchased this saw a few months ago and cannot believe what a piece of junk it is. It cut well for the first few times and then it begin to veer, even when using a saw guide. I was cutting 1/4 in. thick carbon steel at about a foot long so it should be nothing the saw can't handle. I get about 4 inches into the cut before it would veer. The saw's design makes it difficult to see the blade when cutting and the guide sights are worthless.The saw was never dropped or mishandled so the saw shoe was in good shape though it's a cheap piece of aluminum. I replaced the blade because I read that a dull blade can cause a saw to veer. Same result. I have used circular saws before and have never had this problem. Called Evo's tech department and they are useless and will not likely honer there warrenty. Finally I just pawned the damn thing and bought a Milwaukee worm drive saw with a metal cutting blade and have had no problems. My advice would be to buy either a DeWalt or Milwaukee worm drive saw for they are far more reliable 	rgruss	11-03-2016 09:41:51	No Defect	No Injury	Indeterminate			true
42292385	This is a fantastic power screwdriver.  It goes from a pistol-like configuration to a straight configuration for tight places.  Two speed and torque control good for all situations.

38720573	DeWalt's trying to position this saw as the best price/performance option between the lower cost contractor's saws, and the more expensive cabinet saws from Delta and Powermatic.  There is a gap in the market there, but this saw's not the answer.It has some plusses.  The design is a big improvement over most contractor's saws, with the engine cleanly beneath the table, the oversized on/off switch in a place where the saw can be quickly shut down without distraction.  The motor has been sufficient to rip 3 purpleheart when combined with a Forrest II blade.It has considerably more serious drawbacks.First, and most important, the fence is very poor.  It's made out of stamped steel and aluminum, and the design is such that there are strains in every direction based on the cam and the torx screws.  It's extremely difficult to align the fence, and once done, the fence creeps out of alignment after just a few cuts.  And no table saw can be better than its fence.  I removed the factory installed fence and replaced it with a Biesemeyer.Second, the stamped wings are cheesy, and designed that they can't really be set up so they're flush and flat.  It may appear like it's an upgrade from your old Craftsman or contractor's saw, but it's not.  I re-machined one of the wings after adding some bracing, and built a cabinet with melamine top for the other side.Third, the dust collection is very poor.  The small pipe (it really should be a 4) is just kind of stuck there, and installed at an angle, so dust collection setup is both difficult and ineffective.  I built a collector out of old vacuum attachment, and hooked it up to my 4 pipe.  It's not perfect, but it's at least acceptable now.Fourth, the blade guard and kickback pincers are extremely cheesy.  A behind-the-blade splitter is not available on the aftermarket.  You will be tempted to just remove the mechanism, something we all do but shouldn't.  I use a rigged up set of Grip-Tites that I bought here on amazon as a blade guards and anti-kickback pawls.In short, I wanted to get a cabinet saw, decided to save the money and go with the 746 Woodworker's Saw.  Instead of saving me money, I've spent in excess of $700 on upgrades, and countless hours to create a saw that's effective, reliable, and safe.  I should have remembered my first Woodworking Instructor's advice that Only rich people can afford to buy inexpensive tools.  It's been a great learning experience, but I wanted a great saw, not a lesson.I would advise people to either save up for a Powermatic 66, or buy used.  There are really great used saws available; a used Delta Unisaw or Powermatic would be a far better purchase than this offering. 	rgruss	11-03-2016 09:41:51	No Defect	No Injury	Indeterminate			true
